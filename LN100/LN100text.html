<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 100 (December 2011): </strong></p><p><strong>The complete settings of easier lute solos by John Dowland</strong></p><p>For volume 100 of Lute News,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> this tablature supplement begins a series of the lute solos of John Dowland in which all known versions are presented for comparison, and is intended as an appendix to the complete edition of his music published by Diana Poulton.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Here are nine pieces mainly for 6-course renaissance lute that include a prelude, a march, three almaines, and four items with the fanciful titles choyce, delight, thinge or nothing, and jump, the latter probably referring to a dance step. Six of them are dedicated to one of four presumably noble or prominent ladies.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The occasions that prompted the dedications are not known, but it is possible some were Dowland's lute pupils,<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> for which he composed and dedicated a piece for them to play, maybe for a family gathering, such as a birthday celebration.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Alternatively, the music may have been composed for performance at festive occasions and dedicated to the ladies of the households of his patrons, or as a paid commission. It also seems likely that Dowland composed them all rather than arranging pre-existing popular tunes,<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> as all nine have characteristics of his style and the versions are generally but not always (see below) closely concordant. That is, apart from the introduction of variants in harmony and figuration of divisions, or the addition of diapasons (7th course in F or D), or transposition into different keys. It seems likely that Dowland would have varied how he performed his own music, or adapted the versions he gave his students to play, particularly over many years. So variant versions would be copied down at different times, although his music seems to have survived in quite faithful copies. However, the surviving settings offer a glimpse of the forms in which his music circulated, and provides the opportunity to choose a version that best suits our ability.</p><p>The twenty three versions of n<sup>o</sup> 48 are found in prints and manuscripts dated to the 1580s to 1620s. Settings are found in six English manuscripts (ascribed in four), as well as three foreign prints (two ascribed) and nine continental manuscripts (ascribed in four), with three versions found in one manuscript (D-LEm II.6.15) and four in another (Thysius/NL-Lu 1666). Many are concordant, although the versions in the prints of Besard, Fuhrmann and van den Hove have the traits of the compiler's own arrangements. Twelve versions, including all those in English sources, are in G major, and a further nine are in F major and two in C major, although no settings in F or C are found in English sources. This almaine has five sections [ABCDE], used in different combinations with or without repeats, the most complete and arguably the most satisfactory version being n<sup>o</sup> 48k from a continental manuscript. The divisions of n<sup>o</sup> 48m are a single melodic line suggestive of a consort part, and n<sup>o</sup> 48l is closely concordant with n<sup>o</sup> 48m but adds bass notes rendering it a more satisfactory solo. N<sup>o</sup> 48c is found incomplete on fragmentary pages recovered from the binding of other books, and so missing tablature and rhythm signs (in grey here) have been reconstructed from the closely concordant version n<sup>o</sup> 48d. N<sup>o</sup> 48p, t &amp; u use only the first strain to which has been added two further unrelated strains. Settings for bandora, cittern or keyboard are also known, as well as the use of the tune as a Dutch song accompaniment (but see footnote 6). Lady Laiton/Leighton is probably Winifred (<em>d.</em>1616), daughter of Simon Harcourt of Ellenhall in Staffordshire, and wife of Sir William Leighton, poet and composer, and knighted in 1603, whose <em>Teares and Lamentations</em> of 1613/1614 included works by Dowland. Alternatively she could be the wife of Sir Thomas Laiton of Shropshire, Captain of Guernsey, knighted in 1579 and mentioned in New Years Gifts to Elizabeth 1576-1600, or even the wife of Edward Layton, knighted in 1591. </p><p>Two pieces, n<sup>o</sup> 50 &amp; 56, are dedicated to a Mistress White, titled Thinge (or Choyce) and Nothinge, although the music of the two is not related, and may not even have been for the same Mrs. White. Possible dedicatees are Agnes Cecil, sister to William Cecil Lord Burghley, who married Thomas White of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, or alternatively Anne Pilcher, wife of Rowland Whyte/White, Master of the Posts in the employ of Robert Sidney, or else one of a large family of Whites in the book trade, one the wife of the incumbent of St. Dunstan's-in-the West, near Fetters Lane where Dowland lived. Only a single version of n<sup>o</sup> 56 is known, but n<sup>o</sup> 50 survives in nine versions, in one continental and six English manuscripts spanning the 1580s to the 1610s, and one of the latter is the only one ascribed to Dowland. N<sup>o</sup> 50b is from the same fragmentary source as n<sup>o</sup> 48c (see above) and has similarly been reconstructed based on the concordant version n<sup>o</sup> 50a. Most versions are in the key of G, but the one in the ML lute book (GB-Lbl Add.38539) is in F, and one in each key are adjacent in the Sampson lute book (GB-Lam 602). Curiously the version in the Jane Pickeringe lute book (GB-Lbl Eg.2046) is only remotely related to Dowland's composition. Two versions in F are also found as accompaniments to a song in a continental manuscript, the same title also found in a consort version in a continental print, and the music is also called a Polish Dance in a continental keyboard source. </p><p>The identity of Mrs. Nichols, the dedicatee of n<sup>o</sup> 52, is not known. Lute solo versions are found unascribed in two English manuscripts, but the attribution is given in the consort version in Dowland's Lachrimae of 1604, the consort lute part from it that Hove included in Delitiae Musicae of 1612, and in a consort version in a print of Thomas Simpson. The ascription is also found in one of the four continental versions for lute. One of the latter seems to have a German song title suggesting the tune was used as a song accompaniment, although this version is also the only one with divisions. All the lute solos are closely concordant, except for the one in Johann Rude's print that seems to be an unsatisfactory attempt at his own embellished setting. </p><p>Only one of the four versions of n<sup>o</sup> 55 in English sources is ascribed to Dowland, in William Barley's print of 1596. One of the two continental sources is also ascribed, and two anonymous versions for consort are found in Praetorius' Terpsichore of 1612. However, English and continental versions are closely concordant, although only the third strain is found in n<sup>o</sup> 55a, which is preceded by two strains of Wilsons Wilde. Mrs. Winter could be Catherine, niece of William 3rd Lord Vaux and daughter of Catherine Vaux and Sir Thomas Throckmorton, who married William Winter, or maybe she is Jean or Jane Ingleby who married George Winter, whose sons Robert and Thomas Winter were leading conspirators in the Gun Powder Plot.</p><p>The single version of n<sup>o</sup> 65 is presumably dedicated to Fernando Stanley (1559-1594) who was called to Parliament as Lord Strange in 1588-9, retaining the title until he became the fifth Earl of Derby upon his fatherâ€™s death in 1593. The single version n<sup>o</sup> 77 is not ascribed to Dowland, but was included in DowlandCLM as a doubtful attribution. The dedicatee could be a young Elizabeth Norris,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> later to become Baroness Norris, who was daughter of Francis, Baron Norris of Rycote (1579-1622) and 1st Earl of Berkshire, who married Lady Bridget de Vere in 1599. </p><p>One version of n<sup>o</sup> 98 survives and is the only prelude known of John Dowland's. Finally, the almaine n<sup>o</sup> 99 with the obscure title of Dowland's Midnight, is known from two quite similar versions in two English sources from around 1620.<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p><p>Tablature and barring, together with ornaments, vertical and horizontal ties, and dots under tablature letters indicating off beats, have been reproduced as in the original sources. Repeats of sections have been standardised, except for their omission in all versions of n<sup>o</sup> 48. All originals are in French tablature, except for those from A-Lla hs.475, D-LEm II.6.15 and DK-Kk Thott 841 4<sup>o</sup>, which have been transcribed from German tablature. </p><p><strong>Worklist</strong></p><p><strong>50.
