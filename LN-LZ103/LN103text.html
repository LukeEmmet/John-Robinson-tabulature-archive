During this time he returned to Italy frequently, and he died in Bologna in 1588.<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> He was arguably a dominant influence on the development of English lute (and bandora) music, as the five pavans [n<sup>o</sup> 1-5] and three galliards [n<sup>o</sup> 6-8] ascribed to him are highly accomplished and anticipate characteristics of the elaborate style of these typically English genres that followed by composers such as John Johnson, Francis Cutting, John Danyel, Anthony Holborne and John Dowland. That is, however, assuming that he composed the lute music, or at least intabulated it for lute himself from his own music for other instruments, rather than the lute settings having been made by these later composers. In fact, the lute solos are found in manuscript sources dating from the 1590s and one was printed in 1610, so it is possible that lute arrangements were made posthumously. N<sup>o</sup> 1 could have been composed for lute, but the chordal texture of n<sup>o</sup> 2 and 4a/b suggest lute intabulations of consort music, especially as the 6-part harmony beginning the third strain of no 4a is unplayable on the lute. In contrast, n<sup>o</sup> 4c is in a different key and is more like a lute arrangement. Similarly, n<sup>o</sup> 5b could be an intabulation and n<sup>o</sup> 5a a more satisfactory lute arrangement, one version ascribed to Francis Cutting. N<sup>o</sup> 7 is reminiscent of galliards by Dowland, and n<sup>o</sup> 6 survives in eight very similar versions ascribed to John Dowland, Francis Cutting and [Robert?] Hayls, although the ascription of one to Alfonsus, could mean he composed the original and one of the others, probably Cutting, arranged it for lute. N<sup>o</sup> 2c is anonymous but the first strain is related to n<sup>o</sup> 2a/b so may be based on a composition by Alfonso.</p><p>Short items occupying a single stave added as page fillers in lute manuscripts are easily overlooked, but include some attractive music.

Dooland.</em></p><p>Continuing the series of complete versions of the lute music of John Dowland, here are seven galliards, all but one (n<sup>o</sup> 85) known only from a single version for solo lute. Four (n<sup>o</sup> 26, 27, 29 &amp; 30) are unique to Mathew Holmes’ second great lute book, Dd.5.78.3, and the other three are in continental manuscripts: n<sup>o</sup> 85 and 87 in a lute book of Leipzig provenance, and n<sup>o</sup> 103 in Philip Hainhofer’s lute book. N<sup>o</sup> 87 &amp; 103 are not known in English sources, and Poulton doubts their authenticity suggesting that they are at best corrupt versions of music Dowland composed. N<sup>o</sup> 87 is titled galliard although in duple time, which may not be an error, as other duple time galliards are known. </p><p>John M. Ward<sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> identified the fact that the first strain of n<sup>o</sup> 26, as well as DowlandCLM 28, 29 and 84, bears a resemblance to Daniel Bacheler’s galliard on <em>To plead my faith</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> He also conjectured that DowlandCLM n<sup>o</sup> 26 was also the music required for the ditty ‘It chanced on a time, that a lewd theefe did enter in a man’s house’ to be sung ‘To Dowland’s Galliard’ published in Munday’s <em>Banquet of Daintie Conceits</em> in1588.<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> [Additional: 3rd strain of n<sup>o</sup> 27 quotes the opening of John Johnson galliard B22]</p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 85 survives in eight lute versions ascribed in different sources to Dowland, Alfonsus and Hayls, and two lute versions plus a setting for bass viol to Cutting, the remaining three anonymous. Hayls is probably Robert Hales, court lutenist, renown singer and Groom of the Privy Chamber of Queen Elisabeth I from 1582, and then of James I wife Queen Anne of Denmark until he died in 1615. The versions are all too closely concordant to be arrangements by different composers, but its not known which ascriptions are in error. Poulton suggests it is unlikely to have been composed by John Dowland, and is almost certainly by Francis Cutting. Also the title <em>Maister Hayls Gallard</em> could indicate Hayls was the dedicatee, and the ascription to Alfonsus could refer to an original composition by Alfonso Ferrabosco arranged for lute by Cutting. Jan Burgers also suggested that it was composed by Cutting, including the divisions of n<sup>o</sup> 85f.<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p><p>Two of the items here are also known from consort arrangements, one dedicated to Sir John Souch (n<sup>o</sup> 26) and the other to Giles Hoby (n<sup>o</sup> 29), presumably added for publication of the consort versions in <em>Lachrimae</em> in 1604. The former is also based on a lute song in Dowland’s <em>The First Booke of Songes or Ayres</em>. John Souch was the son of Sir John Souch or Zouch<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> of Codnor Castle in Derbyshire. He studied at Trinity College Oxford, was admitted to Gray’s Inn in 1582 and was knighted in 1603. He was likely Dowland’s patron as Dowland dedicated his <em>The Third and Last Booke of Songs</em> to him in 1603, referring to him as ‘my honourable good friend John Souch Esquire’ (he was presumably knighted later in the same year). A Giles Hoby (1565-1626) also matriculated from Trinity College Oxford, in 1583, and was eldest son of William Hoby of Leominster who amassed wealth from the spoils of Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries, but Dowland’s association with him is not known.</p><p>	<em>John H.
