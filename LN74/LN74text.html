<p><strong> Music supplement to Lute News 74 (June 2005)</strong></p><p><strong>Lute Music Ascribed to or associated with Robert Dowland</strong></p><p>This supplement includes all the lute music ascribed to, copied or possibly by, Robert Dowland (<em>c</em>1591-1641). As we all know, Robert was the son of John Dowland and he is best known as editor for the publication in 1610 of his two anthologies, arguably the best English lute print, <em>A Varietie of Lute-lessons</em><sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and the English and Continental lute song collection <em>A Musical Banquet</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> However, the music reproduced here convinces me that as well as editor and lutenist, he was also a composer for the lute ranking equal to his contemporaries Robert Kindersley<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and John Maynard (1577-&gt;1614) and possibly Daniel Bacheler (1572-1619), John Danyel (1564-<em>c</em>1626),<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Robert Johnson<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and Philip Rosseter (1567/8-1623).<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> In addition I am proposing that he was also arranger of earlier lute solos by John Dowland until now assumed to be the contribution of John to <em>Varietie</em>. If true then it is Robert rather than John that shared with some of his contemporaries a propensity for elaborate divisions typical of English renaissance lute music written in the early seventeenth century. I am suggesting that now as well as in his own time, Robert's virtues as a composer may have been overshadowed by his father. This may be because the music more securely ascribed to Robert is not so different to his father's whom he presumably imitated intentionally, unlike Robert Johnson who developed a very distinct style and arguably greater fame than his father John - although we don't know whether Thomas Cutting followed in his father Francis' footsteps as nothing composed by him is known to survive.</p><p>Biographical information on Robert Dowland is preserved in court and other records as well as the preface to his prints but there are periods of his life about which we know nothing.<sup><a href="#endnote-7" id="endnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> From the dedication of <em>Musicall Banquet</em><sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> we learn that he got his name from his godfather Sir Robert Sidney (1563-1626) Viscount Lisle from May 1605, and according to the dedication of <em>Varietie<sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup></em> he received part of his education in the household of Sir Thomas Monson<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> while his father was abroad. His year of birth <em>c</em>1591 is deduced from his marriage allegation of 1626 relating that 'This day appeared personally Rob Dowland of ye parish of St. Anne Blackfriars, London, a bachelor, aged about xxxv yeares and alleged that he intendeth to marry with Jane Smalley of ye same parish, spinster aged about xxv yeares and at her owne disposition, ... and desired licens for them to be married in ye parish church of St. Fayth, London.'<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> The couple had a son John who died an infant in 1627 and a daughter Mary baptised in 1629. </p><p>Recently discovered household accounts of William Cavendish, first Earl of Devonshire (1551-1626), for the period 1608-1624 and probably relating to the London property in Aldersgate Street<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> records payments to at least six lutenists resident in London during the years 1612-1616, including John and Robert Dowland. The accounts for May 1612 include £3 to 'young Dowland' for the cost of a suit, presumably for livery. Four payments were made to Robert between 1612 and 1616, one recorded as a quarter's salary. During this time whilst in his early twenties, his name appears among the lute players for Chapman's <em>Masque of the Inner Temple and Lincoln's Inn</em>, given at Whitehall as part of the marriage celebrations of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, Elector Palatine.<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p>In the early 1620s when Robert was presumably in his thirties he travelled on the continent with a group of English actors, who sought permission in August 1623 to return to England from the Duke of Wolgast in Pomerania.<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Then in January 1626 Robert succeeded to his father's post at court, although the warrant confirming his appointment was not made out until April.<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> He is recorded in subsidy lists or accounts of the treasurer of the chamber (his salary) in all the years up to December 1641. A closer look at this period at court shows that he was appointed as one of the lutes with Robert Johnson, Maurice Webster, Nicolas Lanier and Timothy Collins in 1626, and that the group remained stable for some fifteen years, except that Lewis Evans replaced Robert Johnson when he died in 1634 and Dietrich Stoeffken replaced Maurice Webster in 1635. Robert may concurrently have held other posts in London as he is apparently listed amongst the 'Musicians for the Waytes' in 1641.<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> Of other contemporary lutenists who were members of the court 'lutes and voices', Robert Kindersley died in 1634 and John Lawrence in 1635.<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> Robert himself died late in 1641, when John Mercure<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> was sworn ‘a musician to his majesty for the lutes and voices in ordinary in the place of Robert Dowland deceased’.<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Robert may be the 'Robert Doling a man sometyme servant to the king died in his house in the New Buildings in Chancery Lane the 28th: buried 29 [November 1641]' at St Andrews, Holborn.<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> </p><p>Turning to the music,<sup><a href="#endnote-21" id="endnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> there is no reason to doubt the ascription of the pavan with elaborate divisions dedicated to Sir Thomas Monson (n<sup>o</sup> 1) and an almaine bearing Robert's name in one of the two manuscript sources of it that are known (n<sup>o</sup> 5). The pavan is not known from elsewhere and is assumed to be an original composition by Robert. The anonymous version of the almaine in Krakow 40641 (n<sup>o</sup> 5a) is a simpler arrangement than the one in the Margaret Board lute book (n<sup>o</sup> 5b). The latter is largely written out in John Dowland's hand which presumably authenticates the ascription to Robert, unless he composed it himself and credited it to Robert to further his son's career - it is followed by an alternative, more elaborate, division of the second of the two strains in Margaret Board's hand. </p><p>The ascriptions, or lack of them, of the remaining items are problematic. Lady Clifton's Spirit<sup><a href="#endnote-22" id="endnote-ref-22">[22]</a></sup> (n<sup>o</sup> 3a) is ascribed to Robert in <em>Varietie</em>, but is a reworking of an earlier work lacking divisions by John (n<sup>o</sup> 3b). In the definitive biography of John Dowland,<sup><a href="#endnote-23" id="endnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup> Diana Poulton assumed the ascription was in error and that this later version was also by John but misattributed in <em>Varietie</em>. However, it is difficult to accept that this would have passed the notice of both father and son if one or both were closely involved in the editorial process. Therefore I think it is equally likely that the reworking was by Robert so that the ascription is correct and that John may no longer have been able to improve on his earlier compositions, especially if is he really was as Robert described him in the preface 'to the reader' in <em>Varietie </em>as 'now gray, and like the Swan, but singing towards his end.' In fact, all the seven compositions ascribed to John Dowland in <em>Varietie<sup><a href="#endnote-24" id="endnote-ref-24">[24]</a></sup></em> are reworked to a greater or lesser extent from earlier versions, and Diana Poulton assumed that all revisions were made by John assigning him a major role in his son's publication.<sup><a href="#endnote-25" id="endnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> However, it is surely also possible that the reworking of some or even all were by Robert, and the similarity to the style of his father is because he may even have attempted to imitate it. </p><p>A version of John Dowland's <em>King of Denmark's Galliard</em> is ascribed to Robert in Georg Leopold Fuhrmann's <em>Testudo Gallo-Germanica</em><sup><a href="#endnote-26" id="endnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> (n<sup>o</sup> 4). In this case, the version is not a reworking of John's original but an earlier version with far fewer elaborations than any of John's versions, especially the most refined version that appears in <em>Varietie</em> that is there ascribed to John. So one can only speculate why Fuhrmann ascribed it to Robert, as the latter's known sojourn abroad in the early 1620s was too late to have met and passed on the work to Fuhrmann for inclusion in his 1615 print, and although it is included here, the ascription can only be assumed to be an error. </p><p>A further six anonymous items are also associated with Robert. It might be assumed that Monson's galliard would pair with the pavan ascribed to Robert in <em>Varietie</em> and hence could have been composed by him too. However it is anonymous and although having the same key structure shares little thematic material. Also the pavan is notated for a seven course lute and the galliard for a nine-course lute. I have included the galliard (n<sup>o</sup> 2) and can only wonder who the anonymous composer was, if not Robert himself.  </p><p>Viscount Lisle/Robert Sydney's Galliard (n<sup>o</sup> 6a) is the only lute solo in Robert's <em>A Musicall Banquet</em> and is unascribed so that it is not clear who was responsible for this particularly elaborate version. It uses the strains of an earlier anonymous galliard without divisions (n<sup>o</sup> 6b) and Diana Poulton assumed both to be by John Dowland.<sup><a href="#endnote-27" id="endnote-ref-27">[27]</a></sup> The earlier version carries the appellation 'Suzanna' presumably because the opening is based on the Lassus' setting of the chanson <em>Susanne ung jour</em>. As argued above for Lady Clifton's Spirit, it is possible that John wrote the earlier version but that it was reworked by Robert for inclusion in <em>Musicall Banquet</em>. If so the rather fine divisions in this elaborate version would be the high point of Robert's surviving oeuvre. </p><p>Finally, John Ward has suggested that the hand that copied four corantos into the

I am sure you are not ignorant of that old saying, <em>Labore Deum omnia vendere</em>: And how perfection in any skill cannot be attained vnto without the waste of many yeeres, much cost, and excessiue labour and industrie, which though I cannot attribute to myselfe, being but young in yeeres, I haue ad-uentured like a desperate Souldier to thrust my selfe into the Vant-gard, and to passe the Pikes of the sharpest Censures, but I trust without daunger, because we finde it true in Nature that those who haue loued the Father, will seldome hate the Sonne. And not vnlike in reason that I should distast all, since my meanes and helpes of attaining what I haue, haue beene extraor-dinary. Touching this I haue done, they are Collections gathered together with much labour out of the most excellent Authors, as well as those beyond the Seas, as out of the workes of our owne Countrymen. The treatise of fingering I thought no scorne to borrow from <em>Iohn Baptisto Besardo</em> of Visonti, being a man generally knowne and honoured for his excellencie in this kinde. Put what-soever I have here done (vntill my Father hath finished his greater Worke, touching the Art of Lute-playing) I referre it to your iudicious censures, hoping that the loue which you all generally haue borne vnto him in times past, being now gray, and like the Swan, but singing towards his end, you would continue the same to me his Sonne, who in the meane time will consecrate my best indeauors at the shrine of your fauours, and shall euer remaine obliged vnto you for your curtesies to the vttermost of my power. / <em>Robert Douland</em>.' <strong>The instructions</strong>, sigs.
