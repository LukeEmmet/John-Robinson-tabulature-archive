<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 73 (March 2005)</strong></p><p><strong>Lute arrangements of Scottish and other Ballads - I: John Skene’s mandora book, etc.</strong></p><p>This supplement includes music that can be played on a lute in renaissance tuning that is mainly Scottish, based on some combination of (i) reference to Scotland in the title, (ii) sounding Scottish, particularly the characteristic pentatonic or hexatonic scales,<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> or (iii) are found in Scottish manuscripts.  Exceptions are the French ballet and saraband reflecting French influence in Scotland in the early 17th-c.</p><p>The first twenty items are from the mandora manuscript of John Skene of Hallyards (d.1644), son of Sir John Skene (<em>d.</em>1617), the latter Lord Curriehill and Scottish ambassador to Holland in 1591.  The items here represent an entire section of the manuscript for a 5-course mandora in vieil ton tuning,<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and so can be played as they are on a renaissance lute and have been included in their entirety and in sequence.<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>  The tablature letters of the original have been largely preserved, but occasionally corrupt rhythm signs and barring have been reconstructed, in some cases with the help of the alternative versions in Skene that are in the usual mandora tuning, to render these wonderful tunes playable.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>  However, many of the irregularities in bar length and tempo have been left as in the original.  Alternative versions have been included where possible, illustrating quite different attempts over a long period of time at setting these popular tunes.  The most attractive here is My Lady Laudian’s Lilt (n<sup>o</sup> 8) which is the same music as Lady/Laddie Lie Near Me (n<sup>o</sup> 22), and it is remarkable that the versions found in the Skene mandora book c.1630 and the baroque lute manuscript NLS 9452 <em>c.</em>1635 are so similar.  The meaning of some of the titles is now obscure (Scerdustis, Scullione), whereas others are ballads (the keiking [= looking] glass, to dance about the bailziels dubb, whatever that means, put on your shirt on Monday, blue breeches and blue cap, and love songs I left my love behind me, alas this night that we should part, my mistress' blush is bonny, I long for her virginity and I do not qunne [grow?] cold.  Others are dedicated to members of the gentry including lilts for Lady Rothiemay, Lady Cassillis, Lady Lothian, and music for military heroes like Aberdein and General Leslie, or royalty, as in Henry's galliard.<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p><p>The remainder are mainly from Scottish manuscripts  containing music for lute in French Flat transitional (Wemyss<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and NLS 9452<sup><a href="#endnote-7" id="endnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup>) or D-minor baroque (Balcarres<sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup>) tunings which have transcribed quite well for renaissance lute.  Finally, a few Scottish items are also included from English manuscripts.  The Whip of Dunbain may be a dance associated with a place called Dunbain, which I have been unable to identify.  The Scottish Jig is enigmatic as it is largely unbarred in Holmes' manuscript and remains unsatisfactory and not particularly Scottish.</p><p>As modern editions are available for the Straloch and Rowallan manuscripts,<sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> only one item from Rowallan, the Scottish dance, and three from Straloch that are cognates for other items, have been included.  Scottish music for lute and other plucked instruments, including the few items reproduced here marked in the worklist, are found on CDs of Ronn MacFarlane and Rob MacKillop.<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup>  </p><p>A further instalment (part two) of mainly Scottish lute music will be included in a future tablature supplement, based on all the short items mostly titled ‘A Toye’, and some sounding decidedly Scottish, in Jane Pickeringe’s lute book, plus assorted others items.</p><p><strong>Worklist<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></strong></p><p>Minor editorial changes have been made without comment.</p><p>1.

Matthew Spring summarises Collinson's thumbprints of Scottish music in terms of 'scotch snaps, double tonics, wide intervals, frequent ornamentation, melodic clichés, and tunes ending in notes other than the keynote,' many used in the music here.  <a href="#endnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-2"><p> William Dauney transcribed 85 of the 120 items in the Skene ms in an appendix to his <em>Ancient Scottish Melodies</em> (Edinburgh, 1838). <a href="#endnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-3"><p> See Donald Gill, ‘The Skene Mandora Manuscript’, <em>The Lute</em> xxviii (1988), pp. 19-33, with inventory and concordances. The section in question is found in pp. 81-106, in particular ‘To tune the Mandur efter / the old tune of the F lute’ is written on p. 67, and pp. 81-2 is headed ‘To tune the Mandur / to the old tune of / the Lutt.’, and continues ‘To tune by the unicent. / A in the first [course] and F in the second.

The right hand fingering is also given for the ornaments which can therefore be interpreted unequivocally. A dot after a letter is used frequently and indicates a shake or pull-off from the note above. A wavy line through the tail of the letter 'd' is only used twice in the items here (2nd 'd' in first bar of n<sup>o</sup> 6 and 1st 'd' in first bar of n<sup>o</sup> 10 which I chose to omit), and is fingered the same as the dot ornament.  Most items required only minor editorial changes, but n<sup>o</sup> 4 needed more reconstruction of rhythm signs and n<sup>o</sup> 16 a few added notes as well.  I am aware that other solutions to reconstruction of n<sup>o</sup> 16 are possible. <a href="#endnote-ref-4">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-5"><p> A search of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>, now available on-line if you have a subscription, yielded the following information about the dedicatees of some of the items in the Skene manuscript: Lady Laudian/Louthain (n<sup>o</sup> 8) may be Anne, second daughter of Robert, second earl of Lothian, and hence countess of Lothian in her own right. In 1631, she married William Kerr (1605?-1675), making him third earl of Lothian. The dedicatee could also have been the un-named wife of Anne's father Robert. A less likely alternative is Margaret, daughter of George Campbell, master of Loudon, who married John Campbell (1598-1663), first earl of Loudon from 1633. Lady Cassilles (n<sup>o</sup> 7) is probably Lady Jean Hamilton (1607-1642), daughter of Thomas Hamilton, first earl of Hadington. In 1621 she married John Kennedy (1601-1668), who became 6th earl of Cassillis in 1615. She is thought to be the heroine of Finlay's ballad 'The Gypsy Laddie', and Lady Cassiles Lilt from Skene is the same music as the item titled 'The Gypsy Laddie' in Dauney's <em>Ancient Scottish Music</em> (Edinburgh, 1838). Rothiemay is a parish and village in Banffshire and Rothiemay House is supposed to have given Mary Queen of Scots lodging in 1562. Dauney apparently connected Rothiemay with the burning of Frendraught castle in 1630. Lady Rothemay/Rothemais (n<sup>o</sup> 3), may therefore have been the wife of one of the Gordon's of Rothiemay who were the chief enemies of James Crichton (<em>c.</em>1620-1664/5), first earl of Frendraught. Aberdein of n<sup>o</sup> 5, may be Sir John Gordon (<em>d.</em>1644), who led the Royalist forces at the battle of Turriff in 1639. His son George Gordon was the first earl of Aberdeen. General Leslie of n<sup>o</sup> 9a &amp; b is likely to be Alexander Leslie (1580?-1661), first earl of Leven, considered to have been leader of the Scottish army from 1638. David Leslie (<em>d.</em>1682), first Baron Newark, appointed major general in the Scottish army in 1643 to serve under Alexander, is an alternative. Interestingly, David, second earl of Wemyss, also served under Alexander. Prince Henry (Prince of Wales 1610, <em>d.</em>1612), son of James I is presumably the dedicatee of n<sup>o</sup> 15.  <a href="#endnote-ref-5">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-6"><p> Matthew Spring, ‘The Lady Margaret Wemyss Manuscript’, <em>The Lute</em> xxvii (1987), pp. 5-29, including inventory and concordances.
