<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 37 (March 1996): </strong></p><p><strong>German renaissance lute solos and duets from printed sources</strong></p><p>The tablature in this issue brings together a selection of dances and vocal intabulations in french tablature transcribed from ten of the thirty or so lute books printed in German tablature for renaissance lute. listed below in chronological order, which is different to the sequence of the tablature, arranged to avoid page turns and to keep the duet parts on the same opening. No. 8 is my own transcription of the only complete piece of music in Sebastian Virdung’s treatise on musical instruments <em>Musica Getutscht</em>, 1511 [facsimile edition: Kassel, Bährenreiter-Verlag, 1970], which he transcribed in mensural notation, then in organ tablature, followed by german lute tablature. However, the lute tablature shows the four voices intabulated separately and is unplayable as a lute solo due to the high register of the upper voice on the first course and the fact that two different notes are often found on the first course at the same time. I have arranged the four parts for two lutes in unison giving the upper part to lute I and the lower three parts to lute II. The upper part could be played by any melody instrument, using Uta Henning’s four-part transcription in <em>The Lute Society Journal</em> 15: 20-36, 1973, which also includes a facsimile of the tablature and a translation of Virdung’s instructions. The same tablature was used in the Ottomar Lucinius’s Latin translation of Virdung, <em>Musurgia seu praxis Musicae</em>, 1536<sub>4</sub> and 1542<sub>3</sub>, but the translations into French, published by Guillame Vorsterman, <em>Livre plaisant et tres utile</em>, 1529<sub>2</sub>, and Flemish, published by Jan van Ghelen, <em>Dit is een zeer schoon Boecxken</em>, 1554<sub>9</sub> and 1568<sub>8</sub>, uses a different musical example. </p><p>	Arnolt Schlick ended his <em>Tabulaturen Etlicher lobgesang und lidlein uff die orgeln und lauten</em>, 1512 with the three lute solos transcribed here [nos. 1, 2 &amp; 4]. They are arranged as three part settings, but the altus of the four part original is lacking in ‘Weg wart dein art.’ and could be reconstructed from the vocal model in St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek Cod.463, <em>Tschudi Liederbuch</em>, no. 61 from which only discant and altus parts survive. In addition to the lute solos, Schlick’s <em>Tabulaturen</em> also contains fourteen cantus firmus settings for solo keyboard and twelve textless songs for voice with lute accompaniment. ‘Hertz liebstes pild’ and ‘Maria zart’ were transcribed with french tablature in <em>Lute News</em> no. 11, January 1989 and the <em>LSA Quarterly</em> Volume 24 no. 2, May 1989, respectively [cf. transcription of the songs with texts: Hamburg, Ugrino-Verlag, 1957; facsimile edition: Leipzig, Zentral-Antiquariat, 1977; modern edition of the lute music in German tablature: <em>Die Tabulatur</em>, Heft 3: <em>Arnolt Schlick</em> (Friedrich Hofmeister, Hofheim am Taunus, 1965)].</p><p>	Martin Agricola's <em>Musica Instrumentalis Deudsch</em> is a treatise in rhymed verse based on Virdung 1511, published in editions of 1528, 1529, 1530, 1532, 1542 and in revised form in 1545. It contains a single complete piece of music, no. 7 here. I have transcribed it from a facsimile of the 1532 edition [Hildesheim, Georg Olms Verlag 1969]. Although the original is notated in german organ tablature, it is so idiomatic for the lute that it was surely intended as a lute solo, as Agricola’s heading ‘Auff die Lauten. Ein Tabelthur’ suggests. Did Agricola expect lutenists to sight read from organ tablature?</p><p>	'Konigs Ferdinandus Tantz', no. 3, is from Hans Neusidler’s last book, <em>Ein new künstlich Lauten Buch, Das Ander Buch</em>, 1549, a completely revised edition of the book of the same title of 1544.</p><p>	In addition to the forty lute duets [cf. projected complete edition by Sul Tasto Publications, Vol. 1 published in 1992] in Wolff Heckel’s <em>Lauten Buch</em>, 1556, reprinted in 1562, there are seventy-eight lute solos in the separate <em>Discant</em> and <em>Tenor</em> part-books, forty in the discant and another thirty-eight in the tenor book. No. 5 here, ‘Der Kochelsperger Tantz’ is a solo from the Tenor book and is the second of three using an unusual tuning of the fourth to sixth courses [described in the worklist]. Incidentally, the first of these is ‘Der Juden Tantz’ which is also found in Hans Neusidler’s <em>Das Ander Buch</em>, 1544<sub>2</sub> no. 55, using the same tuning. Neusidler described the tuning incorrectly, causing some recent confusion over his intentions [cf. Michael Morrow, <em>The Lute Society Journal</em>, 2 (1960), pp. 9-12], but Heckel’s clear description unequivocally resolves the problem. </p><p>	No. 6, ‘Der Fuggerin Dantz’, is one of the many german dances in Melchior Neusidler’s <em>Teutsch Lautenbuch</em> of 1574 and nos. 11 and 12 are two 'Tantz-Sprung' pairs one each from Matthäus Waissel’s solo lute books, <em>Tabulatura</em> <em>Allerley künstlicher</em> of 1591 and <em>Lautenbuch Darinn von der Tabulatur</em> of 1592. The comprehensive instructions for the lute in the 1592 book have been translated by Douglas Alton Smith in the <em>Journal of the Lute Society of America</em> 8 (1975), pp. 49-79.</p><p>	Finally there are two more duets for lutes of different pitches, nos. 9 and 10, both from books devoted to lute duets, Gregorius Krengal’s <em>Tabulatura Nova</em> of 1584 containing 37 intabulations and dances for two lutes a tone apart [e.g. in G &amp; A] and Matthäus Waissel’s <em>Tabulatura Guter gemeiner Deudtscher Tentze...auff zweyen Lauten</em> of 1592 which is a modest book of eight short 'Tantz - Sprung' pairs for treble and bass lutes a major fourth apart [e.g. treble lute in G and bass lute in D].</p><p><strong>Worklist</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Schlick 1512, pp. 79-80 <em>All ding mit radt.

Alternatively, to avoid retuning, stop the fifth course at the second fret [c5] and omit the open fourth course [a4] throughout</p><p><strong>5ii.</strong> transcribed for lute in vieil ton tuning</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Melchior Neusidler <em>Teutsch Lautenbuch</em> 1574, sig.
