<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 141 (April 2022): Robert Ballard part 2 - music in his prints ascribed in concordant sources - John come kiss me now - Studenten Dantz</strong></p><p><strong>Robert Ballard part 2</strong></p><p>The first part was in <em>Lute News </em>137 (April 2021) and included music ascribed to Robert Ballard found in manuscripts and prints but not in his own <em>Premier/Deuxieme Livre de Tablature de Luth</em> published in Paris in 1612? and 1614.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This supplement is the second in the series and includes music found in his two prints for which ascribed concordant or cognate versions are known in other sources. To recap, Robert Ballard (1570/5-&gt;1650) was lutenist to Marie de Medici, queen mother and regent (1610-1617), and then to King Louis XIII (r.1610-1643), at the French court from around 1600 until he retired in 1645 (details in part 1).<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Thus he would have witnessed the succession of Ballet de cour performed at the French court. He is known to have 'conducted' the lute music performed in the <em>Ballet de Madame</em> in 1615 and the section headers in his prints refer to the Ballets that some of the dance music comes from,<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> although there is no record of him composing any of it himself. Instead his two books of lute music probably comprise his lute arrangements of suites of dances, originally for instrumental ensemble composed by unidenfied composers that were performed at the Ballet de cour. He was included in a list of celebrated lutenists published by Adam Gumpelzhaimer in Strasbourg in 1621,<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and in a list of lute masters from the time of Johann Baptiste Besard as late as 1727 published by Ernst Gottlieb Baron in Nürnberg.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>The lute sources contain a great number and diversity of courantes and include few examples of exact concordances but instead many different settings of the same courantes as well as more based only on the same melodic phrases in the first few bars. I have been comparing all versions in detail to reveal the relationships between the sources but only comment on them briefly here, focussing more on those that are ascribed to Ballard for which tablature is included. The courantes here share phrases and motifs of figuration between them and different sources of the same courante reveals an additional level of complexity in transmission of what were presumably lute arrangements played and improvised differently every time by Ballard, and performing lutenists in general. Ballard presumably decided which precise versions were included in his prints although it is possible that an additional editor in the printing house also made some contribution to the final version that was typeset - including the apparent errors such as the bars missing in no. 30a, see commentary. Attributing the music here and French renaissance lute music in general to particular composers is also confounded by the conflicting ascriptions in the sources (eg. nos. 28, 29 &amp; 34). It is also likely that as the original dances for the Ballets were probably composed by a team comprising music master, dancing master and copyist-arranger, whose names were not recorded, that the lute settings we have are arrangements and parodies by a number of different lutenist/composers. Alternatively, the team responsible for the music of the Ballets could at least sometimes have adapted music that was originally composed for the lute by the court lutenists at the time, such as Jean Perrichon, Rene Saman, Ennemond Gauthier and Robert Ballard himself. Furthermore, each Ballet de cour would have had suites of related dances based on the same melodic motifs - as with dances for English court Masques - but we do not now know which Ballets they are from as the titles in the sources rarely give a clue and the surviving sources from 1575 to 1655 include selections from around one-hundred and seventy different staged Ballets.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p><p>This supplement includes nine courantes with several sources for each and comparison of the divisions is particularly rewarding. The differences between them are an indication of, on the one hand, the possibility that some sources are arrangements by different composers, and on the other, that the intermittent variants of essentially the same setting may reflect the evolution of an arrangement by Ballard, or whoever,  over time. Variants include the minutiae of stile brisé figuration as well as examples of divisions that digress by an octave into a different register of the lute (such as the A strain of 31 and B strains of no. 29a, 30a and 33a). The figuration in the divisions range from the earlier linear style (such as found in the Herbert manuscript) to the more complex stile brisé, but this does not necessarily mean the versions were by different composer-arrangers, as they may reflect the progression and development over the years of the playing/composing of a composer such as Ballard in the process of developing his characteristic elaborate stile brisé. So it is no surprise that none of the often multiple sources of essentially the same dances are exact concordances for those in Ballard's prints,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and in general the other sources simplify the sometimes dense texture in Ballard's prints by omitting notes and reducing chords to two part harmony. The ascribed examples here are found in only five sources, two prints and three manuscripts, additional to Ballard's two prints, and they are dated between 1610 and 1631: D-B 4022 <em>c.</em>1620, GB-Cfm 689 (Herbert) <em>c.</em>1616-40, CH-SO DA 111 <em>c.</em>1614-20, GB-HAdolmetsch II.B.1 <em>c.</em>1620, <em>Varietie</em> by Robert Dowland in 1610 and <em>Le Petit Boucquet de Frise Orientale</em> by Louys de Moy in 1631). Note that Robert Dowland's print is the earliest and de Moy's the latest, and Herbert is relatively early possibly accounting for the usually linear style of the divisions. </p><p>The fifth courante de la Reine in Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em><strong> </strong>(<strong>no. 28</strong> here) is ascribed to him in three manuscript sources two of which also include divisions in his characteristic stile brisé figuration. All three are closely concordant with the print in the strains as well as identical in some bars in the divisions but distinct in others. Another eight sources are anonymous except one in de Moy's print of 1631 is ascribed to Goutie, probably Ennemond Gauthier, also lutenist to Marie de Medici, <em>c.</em>1600-1631, which might have led to de Moy getting confused about who it was from. The settings are all similar but diverge in figuration especially in the divisions. </p><p><strong>No. 29</strong> is the fourth courante in Ballard's <em>Deuxieme Livre </em>and the opening quotes the beginning of the popular courante <em>La durette</em>, see no. 33. Seven additional sources of no. 29 are known in the same tonality, and another eleven transposed up a fourth as well as three sources of a parody on the same music, all three settings ascribed to Ballard in at least one source.<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The one in Ballard 1614 is in C minor, de Moy attributes a version in F minor to <em>Ballart</em>, and Robert Dowland attributes the parody, in F minor, to Ballard in 1610, predating both of Ballard's prints. At least one sources of all three also bears the name of (Julien) Perrichon, lutenist to Henri IV at the French court around 1595 somewhat earlier than Ballard but surely they were acquainted.<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Some of the titles add more uncertainty as one of the two of 29a ascribed to Perrichon is titled <em>Perichou misse d.B</em>, suggesting it is an arrangement of a Perrichon courante by d'B.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> Of the two of 29b one is titled<em> Le Testame</em>n<em>t de Perichon</em> which could mean it was composed for rather than by Perrichon. And one source of the parody 29c is titled <em>Sur la Courante de Perrichon Jacob</em> probably meaning it is a parody by Jacob [Reys] on a courante by Perrichon, although conflicting with Robert Dowland's attribution to Ballard! Both Perrichon and Ballard could have played an arrangement by one of them, as the sources are quite similar. Finally, another source of 29a attributes it to Besard, but as it appears as a duet in his 1617 print it is likely that he only made the duet arrangement. </p><p>The sources of <strong>no. 30</strong> fall into two distinct groups, one known as <em>Courante Sarabande</em> found in more than twenty sources for lute one in Ballard's 1612 print (no. 30c) mostly settings of the same A and B strains but a few are variations on the B strain only. Other settings are for keyboard, carillon and instrumental ensemble. The other is a parody based on the same material found in just two sources, Ballard's <em>Deuxieme Livre</em> (30a) and a close concordance lacking divisions ascribed to Ballard in the Danzig manuscript (no. 30b). So Ballard may have composed the parody on the well known courante sarabande.</p><p>Courante <strong>no. 31</strong> from Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em> is known from this and ten other sources, three ascribed to Ballard although none exact concordances and the rest anonymous. All four attributed to Ballard are faithful to the courante of two strains of twelve and twenty-two bars, 31d also closely concordant but lacking divisions. The other two are from the Herbert lute book, one closely concordant in the strains but with linear divisions especially in the B strain repeat. The other one in Herbert is titled <em>Ballard Premier Couple</em>[t] <em>Polonois le 2d</em>, suggesting the first strain is Ballard's arrangement (although the divisions are linear rather than stile brisé) and the second by Jacob Reys (quite distinct figuration from the others but lacking divisions), either as a result of a personal collaboration or as a grouping imposed by a later collector of the music, probably Herbert himself. </p><p><strong>No. 32</strong> is the second Angelique, a type of courante,<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> in Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em>, and both the ascribed manuscript sources also call it Angelique, one in Danzig 4022 a close concordance in strains and intermittently in the divisions and one in the Herbert manuscript that is closer to Danzig 4022 than Ballard's print, although the B strain of Herbert is two bars shorter than the other two (and another two bars are omitted in the B strain divisions, reconstructed here). Two anonymous sources are also closely concordant and title it courante and volte but a third source is transposed down a fourth possibly by one of the Gauthiers (Ennemond?) to whom it is ascribed.</p><p><strong>No. 33</strong> is courante sixiesme in Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em> that is presumably his arrangement of the existing harmonised melody called <em>La Durette</em><sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> that is known from about twenty settings for lute as a courante in triple time and another four titled Ballet in duple time. Other settings are for instrumental ensemble, lyra viol, keyboard and a song to the words 'Belle qui m'avez blessé d'un trait si doux'. A different setting with linear divisions is also ascribed to Ballard in de Moy 1631. De Moy begins with the opening phrase found in all cognate settings (also found as the first bar of Ballard's 29a), but Ballard's print introduces a variant extending the falling tone from C to B in the bass to not one but two bars, the same variant also found in two anonymous versions (see worklist below). The other sources comprise a range of cognate settings of essentially the same two twelve-bar strains.</p><p>Courante <strong>no. 34</strong> from Ballard's <em>Deuxieme Livre</em> is concordant throughout with a manuscript source ascribed to Ballard, as well as two other manuscript sources that are anonymous. The figuration is identical in places but different elsewhere, especially the first half of the divisions to the B strain, but all with stile brisé characteristic of Ballard. The remaining eleven sources represent a number of distinct settings, one found in Herbert and the Swan manuscript that is ascribed to René Saman who like Ballard was a lutenist to Marie de Medici recorded 1619-<em>c.</em>1625.<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Other distinct settings include one with highly elaborate divisions in the fragmentary manuscript B-Bc 26369, and two settings in de Moy 1631, the first ascribed to de Moy and the title of the second indicating that it is his own parody on the first.</p><p>The courante <strong>no. 35</strong> from Ballard's <em>Second Livre</em> is unique but is related to a largely distinct courante also ascribed to him in the Danzig manuscript, based on the same opening phrase and similar strummed chords and stile brisé figuration in the divisions. They could both be arrangments by Ballard of related courantes from the same Ballet. </p><p>The courante <strong>no. 36</strong> is in Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em> and two other sources, one in the Herbert lute book and the other a keyboard setting. The two lute sources are the same courante throughout and identical in places but different in others. Curiously the first strain ends on the dominant and the divisions on the tonic with quite different harmony and figuration and the version in the print adds an extra bar (79) in the divisions to the second strain. Both are ascribed to Ballard but the divisions in Herbert are linear compared to Ballard's characteristic stile brisé figuration in his print.</p><p><strong>28a.</strong> Ballard 1612, pp. 44-45 (<em>Covrante de la Reyne</em>) C<em>inquiesme</em>	1</p><p><strong>28b</strong>.

J1 is a single statement of the eight bar tune transcribed from a keyboard manuscript and J2 is a transcription for renaissance lute of a setting of the tune and a division on it for lute in a transitional tuning by John Red found in the Balcarres lute book.<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> </p><p>Although the text of a poem or ballad called 'John come kiss me now' is not known, one presumably existed that predated a moralization on it published in 1567 that began with what was probably the first verse of the original, 'Iohne, cum kis me now, Johne, cum kis me now, Johne, cum kis me by and by, And mak no moir adow' found in Andro Hart's <em>A Compendious Book of Godly and Spiritual Songs</em>, the same first stanza with the tune also found in the manuscript IRL-Dtc 412 (<em>olim</em> F.5.13), pp. 55-56. The tune associated with John come kiss me now seems to predate the text, as the tune lacking the ground is similar to the chanson 'Ma peine n'est pas grande' by Clement Janequin published in Attaingnant's <em>Sexiesme livre</em> in 1545, ff. 12v-13r. Also both the tune and the ground occur in 'Si vous este belle' first found as a lute setting in Pierre Phalèse's <em>Carminum quae chely vel testudine canuntur Liber primus</em> in 1549 as well as in <em>Les Bouffons</em>, which Arbeau in 1589 defines as a sword dance, and found in sources for lute or cittern from the 1550s. </p><p>The tune was also used to accompany at least one other ballad, as the music without title is included for 'As the Friar he went along' in Thomas D'Urfey's <em>Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> 1719 V, p. 58, the same text without music or tune name also in <em>Tottel's Miscellany </em>1557, p. 205 from over a century earlier. The words 'Ioan come kisse me now, once againe for my loue, gentle Jone come kisse me now' are also set as a canon for three voices in unison in Ravenscroft <em>Pamelia</em> 1609, sig. C1v, but to a different melody. However, John come kisse me now is mentioned mainly as a tune for dancing, and rarely for singing or playing, in many plays and poems from the sixteenth to eighteenth century - details of all the quotations I have been able to confirm from online facsimiles and full text transcriptions<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> are in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>,  although two examples are here, 'Yea, many time this love will make old men and women, that have more toes than teeth, dance <em>John, come kisse me now</em>' in Robert Burton's <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> of 1621, line 5523. And the latest is in James Johnson's <em>Scots Musical Museum</em> in 1790 as a poem by none other than the famous Scots poet Robert Burns beginning 'O John, come kiss me now, now, now; O John, my luve, come kiss me now; O John, come kiss me by and by, For weel ye ken the way to woo, O some will court and compliment, And ither some will kiss and daut; But I will mak o’ my gudeman, My ain gudeman, it is nae faute. O some will court and compliment, And ither some will prie their mou, And some will hause in ithers arms, And that’s the way I like to do'.</p><p><strong>J1. </strong>GB-En 9769 84/1.6 (Balcarres), p. 217 <em>John come kisse me now,</em></p><p><em>	by John Red</em> - transcribed from lute tuned edeff	29</p><p><strong>J2. </strong>F-Pn Rés.1186, f. 58r <em>John come kisse me now</em> - trans keyboard	31</p><p>	= US-NYp Drexel 5609, p. 142 <em>John come kiss me now</em></p><p>	Cognates: GB-Cu Add.3056, ff. 69v-70r <em>A Treble</em> = GB-Lbl Add.38539, ff. 11v-12r <em>John com Kisse mee Now </em>= GB-Lcm loan 2019-1 welde, ff. 10v-11r <em>A Treble</em>; GB-En 9769 84/1.6, p. 54 <em>John come kiss me now, or the buffines, John Morisons way. by mr Beck</em> - baroque lute (dfedf).

The other includes two settings in C in duple time, the first on a variant of the passamezzo antico (i-VII-i-V-i-VII-i/V-I) and the second on the passamezzo moderno. All the other settings of <em>Buffons</em> and related music titled <em>Si vous estes belle</em> or <em>Branle de la Torche</em>, are in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>. <strong>App 3</strong> is an anonymous and untitled courante lacking divisions added by hand to the unique copy of Robert Ballard's <em>Premier Livre</em> presumably by or for an owner of this copy of the print. <strong>App 4-7</strong> are four short settings of the <em>Studenten Dantz</em> of two strains on a simple ground (usually i-V-*-V/i or III-V-*-I, in which * represents variable harmony in the 3rd and 7th positions) - another fifty settings for lute or cittern are included in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>. The title suggests it was a didactic exercise given to students and it is remarkable that so many settings based the same ground circulated quite so extensively, mainly in German tablature sources, presumably lute teachers composing their own to give their students.</p><p><strong>App 1.</strong> CH-Bu F.X.11, ff. 19v-20r <em>Les Buffons - Proportio</em>	6</p><p><strong>App 2. </strong>F-Pn Res.941, f. 2v i &amp; ii (Bou)<em>ffons</em> - (Bou)<em>ffons</em>	7</p><p><strong>App 3.</strong> ms adds to Ballard 1612, p. 92 untitled (Courante)	13</p><p><strong>App 4.</strong> D-LEm II.6.7, sig. d3r <em>Studenten Tantz</em>	17</p><p><strong>App 5.</strong> CZ-Pu XXIII.F.174, f. 13v <em>Chorea Studiosorum</em>	19</p><p><strong>App 6. </strong>PL-Kj 40159, f. 16v <em>Studenten Dantz</em>	21</p><p><strong>App 7. </strong>Valerius 1626, p. 25 <em>Studenten Dans</em>	31</p><p>A commentary for the music in this supplement will be found at the end of the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>.</p><p>	<em>John H.
