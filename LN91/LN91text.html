<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 91 (October 2009): </strong></p><p><strong>Twenty Continental Preludes and Exercises from an English Manuscript - Cambridge University Library Additional MS 3056.</strong></p><p>The English lute manuscript in Cambridge University Library with the shelf mark Add.3056 contains seventy solos for a 6- or 7-course lute copied <em>c.</em>1606-1610, and is of interest not least because of twenty continental preludes and similar pieces copied consecutively on folios 21v-32r, all edited in this tablature supplement.</p><p>The lute music in Add.3056 is mainly English in origin,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but also includes an unusual amount of music originating on the continent. It has been argued that some of these preludes were copied from continental prints,<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> such as Jean Baptiste Besard’s <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus </em>1603 [7 items], Georg Leopold Fuhrmann’s <em>Testudo Gallo-Germanica</em> 1615 [3] and Elias Mertel’s <em>Hortus Musicalis</em> 1615 [2],<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> which would not require the owner leaving England if he had access to copies of the prints at home. However, on closer examination, the versions in Add.3056 are quite distinct from those in the prints as well as the continental manuscripts in which some of them are also found. Furthermore, many are quite corrupt with crossings out, omissions with marginal insertions, wrong notes, and incomplete or irregular placement of rhythm signs and bar lines, all suggesting the owner copied the manuscript himself rather than using the services of a professional scribe, as has been suggested.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> So a more likely possibility is that the owner was an Englishman who collected music at home adding the continental pieces while travelling abroad, possibly in the course of receiving lute lessons from a continental teacher.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> If so, he seems to have struggled to accurately write down the music he was given. An equally plausible alternative is that the owner was a foreigner who spent some time in England, and compiled his manuscript from music he collected both here and abroad. Diana Poulton noted that some of the familiar English lute solos in Add.3056 include divisions written in a rather idiomatic style, suggesting the owner made his own arrangements.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> However, judging by the standard of copying of the continental music, it seems more likely that the owner acquired the idiomatic music from someone more capable than himself. So who was the owner?</p><p> The name by which the manuscript is known, the Francis Cosens or Cozens lute book,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> is a curious misnomer and has nothing to do with the original owner who may well be the ‘CK’ who added his (or her) initials to several items now all known to be from the continent and composed by others.<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The presence of a lute solo ascribed ‘CK’ (in fact by Melchior Neusidler) in another English manuscript, Dd.2.11 copied <em>c.</em>1590-1600,<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> suggests that music ascribed to ‘CK’ (but not necessarily composed by him) was known to Mathew Holmes who copied Dd.2.11 while the latter was in Oxford or possibly after his move to Westminster in 1597. A continental link is further reinforced by the presence of a ‘Pavana in fugis CK’ with English traits sandwiched between a version of John Johnson’s Delight Pavan and an otherwise unknown ‘Pauana Dulandi’ [DowlandCLM 86] in a manuscript copied <em>c.</em>1619 in Leipzig,<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> if the initials refer to the same person. Also, of the three versions of Dowland’s Lachrimae Pavan [DowlandCLM 15] in Add.3056, the one followed by the initials CK is clearly a continental arrangement, as it is closely concordant with the setting by Valentin Strobel found in Fuhrmann’s print.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p><p>Turning to the section of preludes and exercises in Add.3056 edited here, n<sup>o</sup> 2-13 are titled preludium, the remainder called exercitium, fantasia, fancye or untitled. Although only two items are ascribed in this section, one to ‘Laurencini’ and another to ‘Equitis Romani’, the composers of several more can be identified from other sources. Seven items [n<sup>o</sup> 7, 12, 14-16, 18 &amp; 20] can be credited to Laurencini, identified as the Roman Lorenzino Tracetti, Golden Knight of the Lute, distinct from another Roman Knight of the Lute who was not a Golden Knight, Vincenzo Pinti.<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> So Tracetti or Pinti could be the composers composer of lute music ascribed ‘Equitis Romani’ in diverse sources. However, n<sup>o</sup> 12 here is ascribed ‘Equitis Romani’ in Add.3056 and other sources, but ‘equitis aurati Laurencini ciuis Romani’ in another, seemingly indicating the Golden Knight Lorenzino Tracetti, and not Pinti, in this case. In addition, n<sup>o</sup> 19 is ascribed to Valentin Strobel in Fuhrmann’s print,<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> and n<sup>o</sup> 11 to Jean Baptiste Besard himself in one of the many concordances. Also a concordant version of n<sup>o</sup> 20 is ascribed to the Parisian lutenist Charles Bocquet in Besard’s print.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> This latter piece is divided into two distinct sections, with different concordances for each section, suggesting that it may be a composite of two different preludes, not necessarily both composed by Bocquet. One further item [n<sup>o</sup> 13] remains anonymous as, although concordant with a version in Besard, he did not know the composer referring to it as <em>incerti Authoris</em> [author uncertain].</p><p>The remaining ten items are anonymous and unique to Add.3056 [n<sup>o</sup> 2-9, 15 &amp; 16], and these, except n<sup>o</sup> 7,<sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> share details that strongly suggest they are by a single composer.<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> So it is tempting to speculate that they may be the work of the owner’s teacher on the continent, or at least someone known to him. They contain many didactic elements that make excellent practice pieces, although none include any fingering indications to guide the student. And the music in this section of Add.3056 known to be by other continental composers also make good practice pieces, and could have been collected by this teacher to enhance the didactic material he distributed to his students. It is also interesting that concordant versions of some of the preludes in Add.3056 are not only found in Besard’s 1603 print but also in a group of manuscripts including 40143 (unnamed owner from Köln), F.IX.70 (the lute book of Emmanuel Wurstisen from Basel), and D-W Guelf. 18.7 (the lute book of Philipp Hainhofer), suggesting a student-teacher relationship between the owners of these manuscripts and Besard or his circle.<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> If so, then this circle could have included the ‘CK’ and the composer of much of the music reproduced here.</p><p>The twenty items edited here have been reconstructed, partly from alternative sources, to present a playable version of each revealing surprisingly attractive practice pieces for lutenists in the twentyfirst century. </p><p><strong>Worklist</strong></p><p>1.
