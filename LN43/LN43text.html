<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 43 (September 1997): English Lute Music Abroad I</strong></p><p>This is the first of a series on English lute music in continental sources comprising lute solos ascribed to English composers which are unique to continental sources. No claim is made that the ascriptions indicate the composers or even that they were lutenists and may only refer to who played, performed or transmitted or collected a particular piece. </p><p>‘Engl Georg Wesper’ may be George <strong>Webster</strong> who was a lutenist in Bückenburg with possible connections with the resident English theatre company in Kassel. He was father of Maurice Webster the lutenist and composer of consort music. Maurice was a member of the consort of James I and Charles I from 1623 until his death in 1636 and one of Charles I’s lutenists in the company of John Dowland, Robert Johnson, Alfonso Ferrabosco and Robert Kindersley. He received payments for strings for lutes, bass lute, viols and violins and may have played all of these. </p><p><strong>1. </strong>Fuhrmann 1615, pp. 116-117 <em>Galliarda Engl Georg Wesper</em>	2-3</p><p>The ‘Jigge of Cooper’ could be an unknown English musician active on the Continent or musician refer to John <strong>Cooper</strong> [1570-1626] the well known composer for viols who travelled to the Low Countries in 1603, to Heidelberg in 1613, and possibly Italy after which he changed his name to Coprario/Coperario.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> UKR-Va 285-MF-LXXIX, <em>c.</em>1600-20, f. 51v <em>Jigge of Cooper</em>	3</p><p>‘Jenickens/Jenicij’ probably refers to an unknown English musician active on the John <strong>Jenkins</strong> [1592-1678] the lutenist and famous composer for viols, not recorded as travelling abroad.

The lute solos here are likely to be anonymous arrangements of pieces they composed or collected for other instruments. However, the <em>Galliard Brad</em> could have been associated with William Brade but is more likely to have been composed/played by his son Christian who was a lutenist at the Danish court 1620-1622 [see Hammerich, A., <em>Musical relations between England and Denmark in the seventeenth century</em>, Sammelband des Internat.

T. Dart, <em>English Musicians Abroad</em>, (<em>Grove Dictionary of Music</em> 5, pp. 949-950]. The Thysius lute book includes two lute pieces ascribed to him, one a consort lute art of a setting of John Johnson's Delight Pavan - see Lute News 139 for settings by Johnson. The other is an untitled almain or ballet. The title <em>Seq</em>(ui)<em>t</em>(u)<em>r</em> and ascription preccedds the no. 15 here, but in <em>English Ballad Tunes for the Lute</em> (Cambridge Lute Series II, 1965/R1975), Diana Poulton assumed incorrectly that the ascription referred to the preceeding piece titled ‘Greene sleves Js al my Joye', a setting of the English ballad Greensleeves.</p><p><strong>14. </strong>NL-Lt 1666, <em>c.</em>1590-1646, f. 147v <em>Pavyn de Lyght Rich</em>[ard</p><p>	<em>Machyn</em> - consort part	11</p><p><strong>15.</strong> NL-Lu 1666, f. 391r <em>Seq</em>(ui)<em>t</em>(u)<em>r Rich Machyn</em> 	12</p><p>Rychard <strong>Sellowes </strong>is another composer name presumed to be and English musician active on the Continent but not known from any other sources.
