The first two parts in the series included ten fantasias, five pavans and three galliards for lute and/or bandora,<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> to which is now added fourteen items all ascribed to Alfonso (although the attribution of some of them is doubtful): intabulations for lute of music for instrumental (4) or vocal (3) ensemble, as well as a treble and ground duet on the Spanish Pavan, passamezzi and other dances (5, one a pavan-gagliarda pair) and a setting of the Battaglia.<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Other lute tablature not included in the series is found in three of the manuscripts from the library of Edward Paston (1550-1630),<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> which include incomplete lute intabulations, lacking the cantus, of seventeen motets, four chansons, two madrigals, two English songs, a lamentation and a Latin song, all ascribed to <em>Alfonsus</em>. He was also a prolific composer of vocal music which was published in collections of madrigals and motets in England and on the continent.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> </p><p>Alfonso was born in Bologna in 1542/3 and was paid a sinecure by the Bologna Senate from 1552 before the family moved to France in 1559 when Alfonso and his two younger brothers entered the service of Charles of Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (1524-1574). The three brothers took part in Du Bellay's <em>Epithalame</em> performed at the wedding of Princess Marguerite, sister of Henri II of France, and Duke Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, for which occasion Alfonso was praised by the French dramatist and poet Etienne Jodelle for his singing. The three were also praised by Pierre de Ronsard in his <em>Hymne de Charles, Cardinal de Lorraine</em> referring to them as the ‘trois Pharabosques Italiens’ probably for their role in 1558 in the wedding celebrations of Mary Queen of Scots and the dauphin who became Francis II of France the following year. Alfonso moved to England by 1562 where he was employed as 'one of the Q[ueen Elizabeth's] Music[i]ons', but in 1563 returned to Italy to enter the service of Cardinal Farnese in Rome although he moved back to England within a year. He was in France again in 1569 and later that year back in Bologna only returning to England in 1572. He is recorded as Gentleman of the Privy Chamber in 1576, but fell out of royal favour in 1577 and was accused of murdering a servant of Sir Philip Sydney.</p><p>He married and immediately left England to stay with the Duke of Lorraine in France on his way back to Italy in 1578, leaving behind his son Alfonso II in England and his wife in France. He was employed by the Duke of Savoy in Turin and died in Bologna in 1588.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></sup> Alfonso had a peripatetic career frequently travelling between Italy, France and England and working for distinguished patrons, so not surprisingly it was rumoured he was a spy. His international reputation would explain how music ascribed to him found its way into diverse sources of English and continental provenance. Assuming he composed all the music bearing his name, the quantity and diversity of his output is all the more remarkable considering he died in his mid-forties. In addition to his huge output of vocal music, instrumental music for one or two lutes, bandora, viols, mixed consort or other instrumental ensembles is also attributed to him, but some may be arrangements of his music by others. As well as singer and vocal composer, he presumably composed and played music for lute and viols, and possibly bandora, although some is in sources compiled after he died so it is possible that arrangements were made posthumously. </p><p>Lute settings of music of three of his relatives are also found in continental sources, but as none of them are known to have played the lute it seems likely the lute settings were made by others. Three canzonette by Alfonso's father Domenico Maria Ferrabosco (1513-1574) are intabulated for lute in a variety of sources.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> Adrian Denss' <em>Florilegium</em> 1594, ff. 27r-31r includes a continuous sequence of intabulations for lute and two voices of nine canzonette by Alfonso's second cousin Matthias Ferrabosco (1550-1616).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> And lute settings of three canzonette by Matthias' brother Constantino Ferrabosco (1550-1600) is found in Johan Rude's <em>Flores Musicae</em> 1600.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup></sup> Alfonso's son, Alfonso Ferrabosco the Younger (1575-1628), also became an influential composer of mask and viol consort music during the reign of James I.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup></sup></p><p>Of the music by Alfonso here, AF1-3 are intabulations of ensemble music. The initials <em>AF</em> of <strong>AF1</strong> probably refer to Alfonso,<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> and it is likely to be a lute arrangement of music for instrumental ensemble à3, but the hypothetical original is not known. <strong>AF2</strong> is a three-part lute intabulation of Alfonso's <em>Miserere mei, Domine</em> [Have mercy on me, O God]<em>,</em><sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> the second part of Alfonso's motet <em>Inclina, Domine</em>. North and Charteris were unaware of this identification of the lute setting, which was reported by Christopher D. S. Field in the revised entry for Alfonso in <em>Grove Music Online </em>in 2010. </p><p><strong>AF3</strong> is an untitled and anonymous lute intabulation in the Hirsch lute book of <em>Quam magnificata sunt</em>, the eighth part of the eleven-part motet <em>Benedic anima mea</em> ascribed to Alfonso Ferrabosco in a set of parts books for five voices in Christ Church Library at Oxford (Och 78-82). The identification was not known to North, Charteris, nor to Robert Spencer when he published the facsimile edition of the Hirsch lute book.</p><p>It is surprising to find a treble and ground lute duet <strong>AF4</strong> ascribed to <em>Alfonces</em> in one of the two nearly identical sources: the Pickeringe lute book with the ground, and anonymous without the ground in Holmes' duet and consort lute part book Dd.3.18. As it is on the popular tune known as the Spanish Pavan, it is unlikely to be a lute duet arrangement of an existing composition by Alfonso. The ascription in the Pickeringe lute book copied several decades after he died, could be an error, but if it was composed by him then one wonders whether more of the anonymous lute trebles in English sources were composed by him as well, and whether he influenced John Johnson's success in the genre. Johnson was appointed at court in 1580 when he must already have been an experienced lutenist and would likely have served a seven-year apprenticeship with some nobleman associated with the court. Alfonso left England for good only a few years earlier in 1578, and so John Johnson and Alfonso were presumably acquainted, and may have played duets together. Johnson was also surely required to play duets and trios to fulfil his court appointment as one of the three lutes, the other two appointments being held at one time by Mathias Mason and Robert Hales.</p><p>AF5-7 are lute intabulations of vocal music.<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> <strong>AF5</strong> is a setting of Philippe Verdelot's madrigal <em>Ultimi miei sospiri</em> (che mi lasciate fredde'e senza vita) [My last sighs leave me cold without life]. It is anonymous and untitled in the Hirsch lute book but a nearly identical version is ascribed <em>Ferabosco</em> in the Schele lute book, so it could be Alfonso's lute setting of Verdelot's madrigal if it is not by another Ferrabosco or just an ascription error. However, a textless setting à6 in the Baldwin MS copied <em>c.</em>1590-1591 is also ascribed to <em>mr: alfonso: ferabosco</em>, which might mean that it was known in England as Alfonso's ensemble setting of Verdelot's original which he or someone else intabulated for lute. Nigel North's <em>Collected Works</em> mentioned but excluded it and it was relegated to an appendix as doubtful in Richard Charteris' <em>Opera Omnia</em>. <strong>AF6</strong> is one of many lute intabulations of the madrigal <em>Io mi son giouinetta</em> (e volontieri M'allegro e canto en la stagion novella) [I am a young girl, and I like to be merry and sing in the new season] composed by Alfonso's father, Domenico Maria Ferrabosco. The setting here is ascribed to <em>Alfonso Ferabosco</em> in the index of Emmanual Adriaenssen's <em>Pratum Musicum</em> published in Antwerp in 1584, but was excluded although listed under works for Domenico Maria Ferrabosco in North's <em>Collected Works</em>, and not mentioned in Charteris' <em>Opera Omnia</em>. It is possible that Alfonso made the lute arrangement of his father's madrigal. However, it is more likely that Adriaenssen made an error in the names using Alfonso instead of Domenico, as all the other names in his index are of the composers of the vocal models not the arranger for lute, who was probably Adriaenssen himself. <strong>AF7</strong> is another madrigal ascribed to <em>Alfonso Ferabosco </em>in the index to <em>Pratum Musicum</em> and is titled <em>Tv dolc'anima mia</em> [You my sweet soul], not mentioned or included by either North or Charteris. However, the vocal original is ascribed to Alfonso Ferrabosco in Pevernage's <em>Harmonia Celeste</em> of 1583. So it seems certain that it is a vocal work by Alfonso, and was probably intabulated for lute by Adriaenssen. Although tablature for the two madrigals in Adriaenssen (only the first included in the revised edition of 1600) is each a complete intabulation of the voice parts, he also provides parts for two voices with text on the facing pages. <strong>AF8</strong> is my own transcription for lute transposed down a fourth from a duet for two viols ascribed <em>Alphonso </em>in a manuscript in the library of York Minster.<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> </p><p>AF9-13 are lute settings of dance music found in continental sources. <strong>AF9</strong> is a gagliarda for lute ascribed only with the family name <em>Ferabosco</em> in Adrian Denss' <em>Florilegium</em> published in Köln in 1594. <em>Florilegium</em> also includes intabulations for lute of nine canzonette by Matthias Ferrabosco (see fn 13). North assumed that Matthias composed the gagliarda too, and it was neither mentioned nor included by Charteris. But North's assumption seems unlikely as Matthias is only known as a composer of vocal music. As lute solos of dance forms ascribed to Alfonso are found in a number of continental prints and manuscripts, it is certainly possible that the gagliarda is by Alfonso too. Pavans ascribed to Alfonso were edited in a previous part of this series (see fn 7), but <strong>AF10</strong> is a doubtful attribution and so was omitted then. The problem is that the sources include a lute solo setting ascribed to Augustine, almost certainly Augustine Bassano, English court musician 1550-1604, which is confirmed in the ascription of a keyboard setting titled<em> Pavana Bassano</em>. But then a mixed consort setting of the same pavan in Mathew Holmes consort part books (lacking treble viol and bandora parts) is titled <em>Alfonsoes Pauen</em> in all the surviving parts. So, were the lute and keyboard ascriptions both errors or was Holmes confusing Augustine and Alfonso, both beginning with 'A'? Alternatively, did Alfonso make the mixed consort arrangement of Bassano's, presumably ensemble, original?</p><p>AF11-13 are three passomezzi, one coupled with a gagliarda, all bearing the full name <em>Alfonso Ferrabosco</em> in Philip Hainhofer's lute books, dated 1603. North doubted the attributions on stylistic grounds and included them in the appendix, whereas Charteris' <em>Opera Omnia</em> did not mention or include them. <strong>AF11a</strong> with seven variations and<strong> AF11b</strong> the paired gagliarda<strong> </strong>with four variations plus ripresa are based on the passomezzo moderno ground (chords on scale degrees I-IV-I-V-I-IV-I/V-I). Alfonso's name appears only at the beginning but it is assumed he composed all the sections of the pavan and gagliarda. <strong>AF12</strong> is also based on the passomezzo moderno ground, and is a single variation ascribed to Alfonso amid a twenty-five variation passamezzo plus ripresa setting (paired with an eleven variation gagliarda plus ripresa), all anonymous except the variation here, and one variation each ascribed to Nicolo Legname (prima parte), J.B. Besardi (sexta parte) and Lorenzino (decima sexta parte).<sup><a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> <strong>AF13</strong> is based on the passamezzo antico ground (i-VII-i-V-III-VII-i/V/i), and is also a single variation ascribed to Alfonso in a larger set of twelve variations (paired with a gagliarda of five variations), the first ascribed to J.B. Bezardj and the rest anonymous. Finally, <strong>AF14</strong> is a battle piece also found in Philip Hainhofer's lute books and is a battle piece based on a different model to those by Jannequin<sup><a href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> and Werrecore or any other battle settings, although quoting similar trumpet calls and other sounds of the battle. A commentary for all Alfonso's music is on p. iv here.</p><p><strong>In Peascod Time</strong></p><p><strong>HU15 </strong>is known as an untitled set of variations on the <em>Hunts Up</em> ground in Mathew Holmes' first lute book,<sup><a href="#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22">[22]</a></sup> but whilst editing it I realised that the melody is the ballad tune <em>In Peascod time</em>,<sup><a href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup> which seems to have been missed by all previous descriptions of the source or the tune, including our Lute Society facsimile edition of Dd.2.11! The tune is included in Claude M. Simpson <em>The British Broadside Ballad and its Music </em>(Rutgers University Press 1966) [pp. 368-370], listing only the cittern setting in Anthony Holborne's <em>The Cittharn Schoole</em> of 1597 (edited in the <em>Lutezine</em>) and sources of a keyboard setting by Orlando Gibbons, but until now no lute setting was known. </p><p>Although an original ballad <em>In Pescod Time</em> is not known the tune is called for to accompany the ballad 'The Lady's Fall' beginning 'Mark well my heavy doleful Tale, you Loyal Lovers all' after which the tune acquired the title <em>The Ladys Fall</em> and was used extensively in the seventeenth century to accompany a variety of other ballads. </p><p><strong>HU15a.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 54r (In Peascod Time)	pp. 2-3</p><p>Holborne <em>The Cittharn Schoole</em> 1597, sig.

To continue the theme of the ostinato bass of Alfonso's <em>Battaglia</em> (<strong>AF14</strong> above), <strong>App 1 &amp; 2</strong> are two different settings of the same Shepherd's or Pastoral dance with an ostinato bass of an open fifth course, presumably in imitation of the drone of bagpipes or similar rustic instruments. <strong>Apps 3</strong> &amp; <strong>4</strong> are two similar lute solos written on a loose sheet in the back of a manuscript recently found in the Stadtbibliothek Braunschweig.<sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> They are reminiscent of the English tune called Kemps Jig, and sound very much like stage music that could have been taken to Germany by travelling English actors/musicians. <strong>App 5</strong> is an anonymous prelude from Mertel's <em>Hortus Musicalis </em>published in Strasbourg in 1615. And <strong>App 6</strong> is version of a <em>Juden Tantz</em> in an open tuning with not one but several repeated notes as a drone,<sup><a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> but is transcribed for renaissance lute here because you will probably not want to retune your lute - if you do, the original is in the <em>Lutezine</em>. To avoid awkward chords in the transcription the droning chords have been simplified to a single bass in C, as found in Apps 1 &amp; 2. More lute solos with an ostinato bass are in the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>, including a setting of an English Battle piece as a contrast to the one by Alfonso.</p><p><strong>App 1.</strong> D-LEm II.6.15, p. 371 i <em>Schafer Tantz 15</em>	15</p><p><strong>App 2. </strong>D-LEm II.6.15, p. 406 ii <em>Chorea Pastorum</em>	17</p><p><strong>App 3.</strong> D-BSstb C 39 2o, loose leaf f. 3v untitled	19</p><p><strong>App 4.</strong> D-BSstb C 39 2o, loose leaf ff. 3v-4r <em>2 Disc</em>	19</p><p><strong>App 5. </strong>Mertel 1615, p. 17 Praeludium <em>39</em>	20</p><p><strong>App 6.</strong> PL-WRk 352, ff. 52v-53r <em>Jud</em>(e)<em>n Tantz</em> - transcribed	23</p><p>		<em>John H.
