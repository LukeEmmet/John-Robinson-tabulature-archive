<p><strong>Music supplement for the Lutezine to Lute News 135 (October 2020): Settings of Deutsch Dantz Magister, Melchior Neusidler part 9 - Gathering peascods - Rogero - La Vecchia - Paganina</strong></p><p><strong>Magister Dantz - Hudson 7</strong></p><p>Here are all the settings I know of another item from Richard Hudson's list of popular Deutsch Dantz.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It is known from only a few sources of German origin and was also transmitted to Italy and The Netherlands. Its German title <em>Magister Dantz</em> is preserved in one source, Elias Ammerbach's <em>Orgel oder Instrument Tabulaturbuch</em> published in Nürnberg in 1583 but in other German sources is simply titled <em>Tantz </em>in Waissel's lute print of 1591 and untitled in the Elizabeth Romers lute book (identical to the first half of the version Adriaenssen used in his print so possibly copied from it). Settings for lute, keyboard and instrumental ensemble are found in Italy titled <em>Alamande </em>or <em>Tedescha</em>, the latter meaning of German origin or allemande, the one for lute in the Herold lute book copied in Padua in 1602. The largest number of sources are found in the Netherlands in settings for lute, cittern and instrumental ensemble often with the title <em>Almande Poussinghe</em>, the origin of which is not clear to me. The sources from The Netherlands are the prints of Phalèse and Vreedman published in Louvain from 1569 to 1583, Adriaenssen published in Antwerp in 1584, reprinted in 1600, and van den Hove published in Utrecht in 1601. The manuscript sources are handwritten additions to the Bodleian Library copy of Phalèse <em>Theatrum Musicum</em> of 1563<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the Thysius lute book copied by Adriaan Smout from the 1590s onwards where it is mistitled <em>Almande Spiers</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The semiquaver passages in H7b/c/f are a reminder that tantz and allemande were slow dances. </p><p><strong>H7a.</strong> Waissel <em>Tabulatura</em> 1591, sig.

The intabulation is of Cipriani de Rore's 4-voice madrigal 'Anchor che col partire io mi sento morire' [Although when I part from you it is a kind of dying] first published in 1547. The version here is one of two anonymous close concordances in manuscripts differing only in embellishment. This one is in a manuscript in Munich comprising pages of handwritten additions taken from several printed German lute books and copied <em>c.</em>1550-1580 (D-Mbs Mus.1627). Also included is an unrelated glossa in A minor from the Barbarino manuscript of Neapolitan provenance (<strong>MN9app 1</strong>). </p><p>In addition to Melchior's version, another twelve lute settings of <em>Anchor che col partire</em> in A minor are found in five manuscript sources and seven printed lute books, including Vincenzo Galilei <em>Fronimo </em>published in 1568 and the latest Emmanuel Adriaenssen <em>Pratum Musicum</em> reprinted in 1600. Surprisingly, the versions in all these sources share many identical bars and passages but differ in the extent of embellishment and so are derivatives of the same intabulation. It seems reasonable to suggest that it was originally made by Vincenzo Galiliei as he did include instructions on methods for intabulation of vocal works for the lute in <em>Fronimo</em>, so he is unlikely to have been the one that borrowed it. Interestingly, the intabulations in the two books each of Phalèse and Adriaenssen are not identical but the later ones are further reworkings of the versions used in their earlier prints. Also, the manuscript sources are concordant but not identical to any of the prints. However, the settings in Johann Rude <em>Flores Musicae</em> 1600 and Jean-Baptiste Besard <em>Thesaurus Hamonicus</em> 1603 are two different and distinct settings. The observation of multiple variants of a single lute intabulation of a one vocal model may or may not be generalisable to other lute intabulations, and confirmation awaits detailed study of more examples. However, this is an example of the work of only one or a few intabulator which was then circulated widely, rather than composers all intabulating it independently. There is also a distinct intabulation in a different tonality (G minor) found in Jean Paul Paladin's <em>Premier Livre de Tablature de Luth</em> published in Lyon in 1560 and copied almost identically without ascription <em>c.</em>1565 into the autograph manuscript of Giovanni Pacaloni of Padua where it is accompanied by a parody fantasia in G minor not found in Paladin's prints, also included here (<strong>MN9app 2</strong>). Reworkings of this too are found in six further sources, one with text and an added voice part and so either Paladin was the original intabulator or maybe he reworked it from an existing source so the intabulator is not known.</p><p>The dance titled <em>Der Nerrisch/Närrisch Caspar</em>, subtitled the King in Poland's dance, is in A minor and ascribed to Melchior by initials MN only. The setting is unique to one of the Donaueschingen manuscripts, probably copied at the Munich court <em>c.</em>1580-1595, but a simple and distinct setting in G minor is found in the lute book of Emanuel Wurstisen from Basel (<strong>MN9app 3</strong>), both probably arrangements of an existing popular dance. The title probably refers to 'Błazeński Kasper' in Polish or 'Der Närrisch Caspar' in German [Clownish Caspar], a stock character from the German farce tradition dating back to the Middle Ages.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p><p><strong>MN9a.</strong> D-B Mbs 1627, ff. 15v-16v <em>Fantasia super </em></p><p><em>	anchor che col partire: di M: Melchior Neusidler 1572</em>	pp. 8-9</p><p>	Neusidler 1574, sigs.

The first two bars are the same as one of the two ballad tunes known as <em>All in a garden green</em> / <em>Onder de Lindegrone</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> It may not have been used as a ballad tune as no text or reference to a ballad called <em>Gathering peascods</em>, or examples of other ballads calling for the tune are known but the music is found in instrumental settings for lute, bandora and keyboard from the 1590s onwards under several alternative titles. Settings of essentially the same music are titled<em> The Gathering of pescodes</em> in the Board lute book and <em>Brande Piscet </em>(probably a corruption of the English title)<em>/ Chanson Angloise</em> in Valerius' <em>Nederlandtsche Ghedenck-Clanck</em> published in Haarlem in 1626. It is also called <em>Johnsons Toy</em> and <em>Jo Johnsons Allmaine</em> in settings for lute or bandora, so either John Johnson composed the music that became a popular country dance under the title Gathering peascods, or more likely he arranged music that was already known. Either way he presumably intended it for lute and someone else then arranged it for bandora retaining the ascription to him. It is also known by the title <em>Allins Jig </em>and although it is not in jig form<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> it is assumed to refer to Edward Alleyn (1566-1626) a celebrated actor on the Elizabethan stage. He is a more likely candidate than the professional singer John Alleyn ‘that most excellent <em>tenor</em> voyce, and exact singer (her mat<sup>ies</sup> seruant, <em>mr. Io. Allin</em>)’ who sang the song ‘If all the ages of the earth’ by Alfonso Ferrabosco (II) in Ben Jonson's <em>Queens Masque </em>performed in the Whitehall Banqueting House in 1609<sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Presuming that it was for Edward Alleyn, it may have been used as his signature tune during his performances and its use on stage would explain its inclusion as an untitled lute setting in D-B 4022, a manuscript of Gdansk provenance that probably includes English music brought by troupes of English actors that are recorded as visiting Gdansk frequently between 1600 and 1619.<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Eight sources are included here (repeating those that were in <em>Lute News</em> 135), six for lute, one for bandora (a transcription for lute was in <em>Lute News</em>) and one arranged from Playford's violin melody.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p><p><strong>GP1.</strong> GB-Lam 603 (Board), f. 26r <em>The Gathering of pescodes</em>	p. 22</p><p><strong>GP2.</strong> D-B 4022, f. 43v untitled	22</p><p><strong>GP3.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 56r<em> Allmaine Jo Johnson </em>- JohnsonB<sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> 31	23</p><p><strong>GP4.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 28r <em>Allins Jigg</em>	23</p><p><strong>GP5.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 20v <em>Johnsons Toy</em>	23</p><p><strong>GP6.</strong> NL-Lt 1666 (Thysius), f. 456v <em>Brande Piscet.

George Gascoigne refers to it in 'The Adventures of Master F. J.' included in his <em>Hundred Flowres</em> published in 1573, when the hero Ferdinando 'taking into his hand a Lute that lay on his Mistresse bed, did unto the note of the Venetian galliard apply the Italian dittie written by the worthy Bradamante unto the noble Rugier, as Ariosto hath it: Ruggiero, qual sempre fui &amp;c' - which is canto 44 line 61 of Ludovico Ariosto's epic poem <em>Orlando Furioso</em> (in which Bradamante is the knight heroine) published in 1532 and in English translation in 1591. In 1586 William Webbe refers to the popularity of setting ballads to the tune of <em>Rogero</em> in his <em>Discourse of English Poetrie</em> of 1586, in his comment that 'The seauenth sorte is a verie tragicall mournefull measure, wherin he bewayleth the death of some freend vnder the person of Dydo. ... These sortes of verses for breuities sake haue I chosen foorth of him, wherby I shall auoide the tedious rehearsall of all the kinds which are vsed: which I thinke would have beene vnpossible, seeing they may be altered to as manie formes as the Poets please: neither is there anie tune or stroke which may be sung or plaide on instruments, which hath not some poetical ditties framed according to the numbers thereof, some to Rogero, some to Trenchmore, to downe right Squire, to Galliardes, to Pauines, to Iygges, to Brawles, to all manner of tunes which euerie Fidler knowes better then my selfe, and therefore I will let them passe'. For another Italian ground popular in England see La Vecchia/Paganina below. Examples of the use of Rogero in books include Richard Jones's <em>Handefull of pleasant delites</em> of 1584, first published in 1566 but now lost, in which number twenty eight is 'A faithfull vow of two constant Lovers sung To the new Rogero<em>' </em>beginning 'Shall distance part our loue, or daily choice of chaunge' (new probably signifies revival of the tune rather than implying that it was different to an old rogero which is nowhere so named), and in <em>Strange Histories</em> of 1602 Thomas Deloney included 'The Kentishmen with long tayles Cant. I or to the tune of: Rogero' beginning 'The valiant courage and policie of the Kentishmen with long tayles'. And Richard Johnson's <em>Golden Garland of Princely Pleasures</em> of 1620 includes 'A Lamentable Song of Lady <em>Elinor,</em> daughter to the Duke of Buckingham, who dyed for loue of one Captaine <em>Ienkenson</em> that had been a Prentise of London, who went to the siege of Ierusalem with <em>Edward</em> the first, then King of England To the tune of Rogero' beginning 'In England liued once a Duke, That had a daughter braue'. However, Tobias Hume disparages arrangements based on Italian grounds in his address 'To the vnderstanding Reader' of <em>The First Part of Ayres</em> of 1605 (sig. B2v), repeated in <em>Poetical Musicke</em> 1607 (sig. G1v), proudly declaring that 'my studies are farre from seruile imitations, I rob no others inuentions, I take no Italian Note to an English Dittie, or filch fragments of Songes to stuffe out my volumes'. Rogero was nevertheless frequently called for to accompany ballads from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. Between them Broadside Ballads Online at the Bodleian and the English Broadside Ballad Archive at the University of California Santa Barbara,<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> catalogue at least forty three prints and reprints of ballad sheets of nine distinct texts set to the tune of Rogero from the 1570s to the late eighteenth century.<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> </p><p>Although sharing bars in places, seven distinct solo settings of Rogero for lute are known with between one and four variations. All are anonymous except for a fragment of half of a single statement (reconstructed here) ascribed to John Johnson (<strong>R6</strong>). The solos are in C major (<strong>R2, R3, R5</strong> and two sources of <strong>R1</strong>) or F major (<strong>R7</strong>), the latter the only one in a continental source and probably influenced by the Englsih Rogero rather than the original Italian Rugierro. A bandora solo (or is it a ground?) is in the Dallis lute book (<strong>R8i</strong>), also transcribed for lute here (<strong>R8ii</strong>). Two treble and ground duets are also known one by John Johnson, in G major - all four sources included (<strong>R10ia-d</strong>), one of them found in a continental source and quite different in places and lacking the final triple time variation.<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> The other treble and ground duet is anonymous and in C major (<strong>R4</strong>) and both the trebles lack surviving grounds which have been reconstructed by others (<strong>R4ii, R10iiab</strong>). The four sources of R10 are nearly identical, but the fourth variation of five is missing in R10a, and R10d is incomplete, terminating halfway through bar 22 due to a missing page. One keyboard setting and four for solo cittern (<strong>R12-15</strong>) are also known, as well as a bass viol part comprising a single statement of the ground, in one of Mathew Holmes' consort books (<strong>R16</strong>). Lyle Nordstrom classified the first four items in Holmes' cittern part book to be cittern solos and they are complete in themselves, but it is curious that Rogero is the first piece copied in Dd.14.24 as well as the first in the bass viol part book Dd.5.20, suggesting they were related.<sup><a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup></p><p><strong>R1a. </strong>GB-Lam 602 (Sampson), f. 3v <em>Rogero</em>	p. 26</p><p><strong>R1b.</strong> GB-Lam 603, f. 2r <em>Rogero</em>	27</p><p><strong>R2.</strong> IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13 (Marsh), p. 38 untitled	28-29</p><p><strong>R3. </strong>IRL-Dtc 410/I, pp. 20-21 <em>ROGERO - the Division of RoGero before</em> 	29</p><p><strong>R4i.</strong> IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13, p. 39 untitled - duet treble Lundgren<sup><a href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> 1	30-31</p><p><strong>R4ii. </strong>ground reconstructed by Stefan Lundgren	31</p><p><strong>R5. </strong>IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13, p. 305 untitled	32</p><p><strong>R6. </strong>IRL-Dtc 408/II, p. 91 <em>Rogero qd Jo Johnson</em> - JohnsonB 33	34</p><p><strong>R7. </strong>NL-Lu 1666, f. 383r <em>Rogier</em> 	33</p><p><strong>R8i.</strong> IRL-Dtc 410/I, p. 223 <em>Rog</em>(er)<em>o</em> - bandora Nordstrom<sup><a href="#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22">[22]</a></sup> 27 	39</p><p><strong>R8ii.</strong> IRL-Dtc 410/I, p. 223 <em>Rog</em>(er)<em>o</em> - transcribed for lute	33</p><p><strong>R9.</strong> GB-Cu Add.8844 (Trumbull), f. 25v i untitled	34</p><p><strong>R10ia.</strong> GB-Lam 601 (Mynshall), f. 3v <em>The heare <s>of</s> trebble of Rogeroe</em>	35</p><p>	[index: <em>The heier trebble of Rogero</em>] - treble variations 1, 2 &amp; 5</p><p><strong>R10ib.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.3.18, f. 1r <em>Rogero Jo: Johnson</em> [index: <em>Rogero</em>] 	36-37</p><p>	- duet treble, variations 1-5 JohnsonB 61; Lundgren 14</p><p><strong>R10ic. </strong>NL-Lu 1666, ff. 383r-384r untitled - treble	38-39</p><p><strong>R10id. </strong>GB-Cu Add.8844, f. 25v ii untitled - treble	40</p><p><strong>R10iia. </strong>ground reconstructed by Anthony Rooley/Stefan Lundgren	37</p><p><strong>R10iib.</strong> ground reconstructed by Jan Burgers<sup><a href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup>	37</p><p><strong>R11.</strong> IRL-Dtc 410/I, p. 92 <em>Rog</em>(er)<em>o to the grounde</em>	p. 39</p><p><strong>R12.</strong> GB-Cu D14.24, f. 1r <em>Rogero</em> - cittern solo	41</p><p><strong>R13.</strong> GB-Cu D4.23, f. 23v <em>Rogero</em> - cittern solo	41</p><p><strong>R14.</strong> J-Tn BM-4540-ne, sig.

The anonymous solo settings of the pavan are in C major and are more satisfactory than Johnson's solo which has running melodic passages more like a consort part. A simple setting without divisions is in the Dallis lute book (<strong>LP2</strong>) and one with divisions is concordant between several English sources that mostly differ in ornamentation and fingering indications (<strong>LP1a-d</strong>). Two more solos are in continental sources, a delightful setting in the Königsberg lute book (<strong>LP3</strong>) and an elaborate setting probably arranged by Joachim van den Hove for his <em>Florida</em> published in Utrecht in 1600 (<strong>LP4</strong>).<sup><a href="#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24">[24]</a></sup> Two setting are for bandora, a consort part, in the Königsberg lute book (<strong>LP11</strong>) that carries enough of the tune to pass as a solo, and a more accomplished setting with divisions in Mathew Holmes' first lute book (<strong>LP5</strong>), both transcribed for lute here and the original of LP3 included for bandora players as it is a great solo for the instrument. In fact, although anonymous, the figuration is reminiscent of Anthony Holborn who did compose for bandora, including an arrangement of a lute Pavan by John Johnson (JJ1 in <em>Lute News</em> 135) the bandora setting ascribed to Holborn (GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 69r <em>Pauen A: Holburn</em>). Three accomplished arrangements are also known for cittern (<strong>LP8-10</strong>), one in the Otley cittern book and two similar but distinct settings in Anthony Holborn's<em> Citharn Schoole</em> of 1597 and so probably made by him. Three lute duets all in G major are also included here. In addition to his lute solo, a duet for equal lutes is ascribed to John Johnson (<strong>LP6</strong>), found in four sources (both parts together only in one), all nearly identical so only one of each part is reproduced here. Matthew Holmes' book of consort and duet parts for lute also includes what has been assumed to be a consort lute part, but it looks more like a treble to me entirely lacking any harmony in the strains or divisions until the final chord (<strong>LP7</strong>), so I have treated it as a treble and used the bass viol part from the Walsingham consort books as a ground, played on lute or bass viol. </p><p>Three lute settings and an orphan mixed consort cittern part of the paired La Vecchia galliard are known: an anonymous solo in the Marsh lute book (<strong>LG1</strong>) assumed to be by John Johnson to go with his lute solo, and two equal duets, one anonymous (<strong>LG2</strong>) and the other ascribed to John Johnson (<strong>LG3</strong>).<strong> </strong></p><p>JJ2a.<strong> </strong>D-Hs ND VI 3238, pp. 143-144 untitled - consort part	<em>Lute News</em></p><p>JJ2b.
