<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 135 (October 2020): John Johnson's music in continental sources part 1 plus additional cognates of Mounsieur's almaine </strong></p><p><strong>John Johnson's music abroad - part 1</strong></p><p>The availability of collected editions<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> of the music of the English court lutenist and first known great native English lute composer John Johnson (<em>d.</em>1594) has until now led me to exclude his music from tablature supplements. However, an interest in the transmission of English lute music to continental Europe led me to consider his music found in continental sources as well as to rediscover just how rewarding his music is to play. I would like to dedicate this supplement to the memory of Julian Bream who was a great pioneer and champion of English lute music and his concerts and recordings prompted my interest in the lute in the 1960s.</p><p>None of the continental sources bear Johnson's name and he is not known to have travelled beyond England so it is likely his music was introduced to the continent by others, especially troupes of travelling English actors and musicians. The continental sources are listed in the collected editions but only as secondary sources and so were not chosen as musical examples. Thus, editing the continental versions (eight here, plus Rogero in the <em>Lutezine</em> and another eight in a subsequent supplement) serves as an appendix to the collected editions and reveals the diversity in figuration of essentially the same music as it was transmitted to the continent from source to source or from one player to another (see the detailed analysis of sources in JohnsonB referred to in fn 1 here). Also the continental settings are often simpler versions in which the melodies and harmonies can be more clearly heard free of excess embellishment better exposing the beauty of the music of Johnson the Elder. All his music is for six course lute apart from a few later sources including some of the continental settings (JJ2a, 6a, 7d,e,h) that add a seventh course tuned to F or D. Each continental version here is accompanied by one of the English sources for comparison, usually different to the ones used in the collected editions. I have also listed all the concordances I know as well as the recordings known to me of the music included here.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>A number John Johnson's works survive in versions for solo lute, lute duet, keyboard and mixed consort and it is not clear how close any of them are to his original intentions and which are arrangements by others. Three of a total of thirty six lute solos and sixteen duets ascribed to him are also found in arrangements for solo bandora and another five for solo cittern in addition to six for mixed consort and seven for keyboard - presumably all these arranged by others. </p><p>JJ1 is a pavan in C major with three strains of 6, 6 and 4 bars based on the passomezzo moderno ground (I-IV-I-V-I-IV-I/V-I). It is found without ascription in Joachim van den Hove's <em>Florida</em> published in Utrecht in 1600 (<strong>JJ1a</strong>), which is a close concordance for a pavan ascribed to John Johnson in one English source and just Johnson in another. Hove seems to have followed a version of the original English setting (see <strong>JJ1b</strong> for comparison) rather than attempting any arrangement himself, apart from simplifying the figuration here and there and substituting his own bar eleven which is uncharacteristic of Johnson. Fragments of the A and B strains and repeats are also found in the page fragments GB-Och 1280,<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and a bandora setting with different divisions is ascribed to A(nthony) Holburn, who may have arranged Johnson's original unless the ascription by Mathew Holmes is an error. </p><p><strong>JJ1a.</strong> Hove <em>Florida</em> 1601, f. 91r <em>Pauana</em> - HoveB<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> 364	pp. 2-3</p><p><strong>JJ1b.</strong> GB-Cu 8844 (Trumbull), ff. 5v-6r <em>A pauan m<sup>r</sup> Johnson </em>	4-5</p><p><em>	</em>- JohnsonB 4; HolbornS<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> 87 </p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 69r <em>Pauen A Holburn </em>- bandora HolbornS 69 </p><p>	GB-Och 1280, f.

One of the many settings of La vecchia pavan is found untitled in a lute book of German provenance inscribed Ernst Schele (<strong>JJ2a</strong>), which is concordant, except the divisions, with a lute setting titled <em>Levecha pavin m Johnson</em> (in the style of John Johnson not his son Robert) in the Folger-Dowland lute book (<strong>JJ2b</strong>), and an untitled fragment of the first twelve bars. The divisions in the Schele setting consist mainly of a single upper voice in semiquavers lacking any chords or bass notes, suggesting it is a lute part of a mixed consort setting. The divisions to both the Schele and Folger settings are quite different but are both mainly fast melodic passages although Folger includes some of the bass notes of the harmony and so this setting seems to be intermediate between a consort and solo setting. I have added similar bass notes editorially to the Schele setting to make it more like a solo to facilitate comparison with Folger. But you will see that the divisions in the cognate solos in the <em>Lutezine</em> have more rhythmic and harmonic complexity, so it seems that a satisfactory solo setting by John Johnson does not survive. A duet for two lutes in unison with equal parts (that is not treble and ground) of La vecchia pavan (and galliard) is also ascribed to Johnson in one of the four English sources (both parts together only in one source). As with the consort part in Schele, there are fast passages of melody without bass notes but in the duet parts the fast passages alternate between the lutes within the same strain rather than being confined only to the divisions as in the consort part. Interestingly none of the passages in the duet correspond to the figuration in Johnson's solos above. All the sources of La Vecchia pavan and galliard and Paganina that I know for lute are edited in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>.</p><p><strong>JJ2a. </strong>D-Hs ND VI 3238 (Schele), pp. 143-144 untitled	6-7</p><p><strong>JJ2b.</strong> US-Ws V.b.280 (Folger), f. 12r <em>Levecha pavin m<sup>r</sup> Johnson</em>	8-9</p><p>	- JohnsonB 11<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p><p>	US-NH Deposit 1 (Wickhambrook), f. 14r untitled (bars 1-12 only)</p><p>	equal duet: </p><p>	US-NH Deposit 1, f. 15v i untitled - lute I </p><p>	- JohnsonB 51a; Spencer<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> 3a; Lundgren<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> 4a</p><p>	GB-Lbl Eg.2046, f. 4r <em>the pauecheo for ii lutes Johnsone</em> - lute I incomplete </p><p>	IRL-Dtc 408/I, p. 45 <em>Lavecho for two Lutes</em> - lute I</p><p>	US-NH Deposit 1, f. 15v ii untitled - lute II </p><p>	- JohnsonB 51b; Spencer 3b; Lundgren 4b</p><p>	= GB-AB I/27 (Brogyntyn), pp. 28-29 <em>Leueche pauen</em> - lute II</p><p><strong>JJ3a</strong> is a lute setting without divisions of John Johnson's Flat pavan. It is found in a manuscript copied at the Königsberg court of the Dukes of Prussia probably in association with the troupe of English actors under John Spencer alias Stockfish, who were based in Königsberg <em>c.</em>1605-<em>c.</em>1619, or possibly another troupe who performed periodically in Königsberg under George Webster and including Richard Machin, to whom music is ascribed in the manuscript.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> Johnson's Flat pavan, probably named after the flattened note in the opening melody, is known from more than twenty sources for lute (see <strong>JJ3b</strong> for an English example), mixed consort and keyboard, and JJ3a here is the only one not of English provenance. The lute solos, including the continental source, are all quite closely concordant. As with JJ1 above, the music was called for to accompany one of the ditties in Munday 1588.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Figuration in the divisions of the lute solos, equal duet and treble and ground duets (with settings in both F and G minor) and the consort lute parts are concordant in places and so are possibly all arrangements by John Johnson himself or musicians associated directly with him. These related settings for different instrumental forces are good examples to compare solo, equal duet, treble and consort parts. The solos include harmony throughout the strains and divisions, although in the divisions the melody is often obscured by semiquaver passages punctuated with only occasional bass notes (see JJ4b for an example). In the equal duets the parts (not edited here) are similar both including alternating semiquaver passages lacking bass notes and chordal sequences within strains as well as repeats to produce echo effects between the two lutes. The consort lute parts are similar to the equal duet parts except that the strains are all chordal and the divisions all quaver and semiquaver passages almost entirely lacking bass notes. Finally, the duet trebles comprise continuous semiquaver passages except for bass notes only at cadences, and the chordal harmony is confined throughout to the lower voices of the ground for the second lute. However, the differing extent to which settings adhere to these patterns introduces ambiguity in assigning some to one use or another when there is no clue in the titles (such as US-Ws V.b.280, f. 10r <em>the flatt pavin for consorte</em>), that is if they were considered distinct rather than interchangeable in their use. For example, the lute setting GB-Cu Dd.3.18, ff. 60v-61r <em>flatt Pauen</em> consists of mainly quaver and semiquaver passages with only three bass notes and so looks like a treble, but then it is concordant in many places with the consort lute settings despite lacking bass notes and is very different to the duet treble settings.</p><p><strong>JJ3a. </strong>LT-Va 285-MF-LXXIX, f. 55r <em>Flatt Pauan NB</em>	p. 10</p><p><strong>JJ3b. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 87r<em> The flatt pauen Jo Johnson</em>	10-11</p><p>	GB-Gu Euing 25, f. 8v untitled</p><p>	GB-Lam 601(Mynshall), f. 4v <em>the flate pauiane</em> [index: <em>The flatt pauion</em>]</p><p>	GB-Lam 603 (Board), f. 2v <em>Flatt Pavin Flatt Pavin M<sup>r</sup> Johnso</em>[n]</p><p>	 - JohnsonB 13b</p><p>	IRL-Dtc 408/I, p. 18 <em>The flat Paven</em> - JohnsonB 13a</p><p>	IRL-Dtc 410/I (Dallis), p. 92 <em>NB Jhonsons Flatt pauin</em></p><p>Equal Lute duet: JohnsonB 53</p><p>	GB-Lbl Eg.2046, ff. 4v-5r<em> the flatt pauion for ij luttes by Johnsone</em> - lute I</p><p>	GB-Lbl Eg.2046, f. 5r <em>the flatt pauion for ij luttes by Johnsone</em> - lute II</p><p>	GB-Cu Add.8844, f. 15r untitled - lute II</p><p>T&amp;G duet in F minor: JohnsonB 55 (ground reconstructed)</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.3.18, f. 21v <em>The flatt pauen</em> - treble - Lundgren 24a</p><p>T&amp;G duet in G minor: (no ground)</p><p>	GB-Cu Add.8844, ff. 17v-19r untitled - treble</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.3.18, ff. 60v-61r <em>flatt Pauen</em> - treble</p><p>Mixed consort: </p><p>	GB-Cu Add.8844, f. 10r <em>The flat pavan</em> - lute part</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.3.18, ff. 60v-61r <em>flatt Pauen</em> - lute part</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.9.33, ff. 90v-91r <em>flatt paven</em> - lute part</p><p>	US-Ws V.b.280, f. 10r <em>the flatt pavin for consorte</em> - lute part</p><p>	GB-Lam 600, f. 13v <em>Flat Pauin</em> - bandora part</p><p>	LT-Va 285-MF-LXXIX (Königsberg), f. 39r <em>Flatt pavine</em> - bandora part</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.14.24, f. 3v <em>The flatt paven</em> - cittern part</p><p>	US-CA Mus.181 (Otley), f. 2v <em>Jhonsones paven</em> - cittern part</p><p>	US-CA Mus.181, f. 37v <em>Flat Pa / the flat pauine</em> - cittern part</p><p>	US-OAm Parton, p. 19 <em>.24.

It is the only continental source of the galliard to John Johnson's Flat pavan. As with the pavan, sources of the galliard include settings for lute solo (see <strong>JJ4b</strong> for an example) and equal duet, as well as treble and ground duet (although the ground does not survive but has been reconstructed), and mixed consort but only parts for cittern and bass viol are known. The five solo lute settings, including the continental source, are all in C minor and closely concordant. </p><p>The Flat pavan and paired galliard are found together in the Mynshall and Dublin (408/II) manuscripts, and both are in Mathew Holmes first lute book, Dd.2.11 copied over the long the period <em>c.</em>1588-1600, but the pavan is on near the end on f. 87r of 102 folios whereas the galliard is right at the beginning on f. 1v. He may have collected and copied them on separate occasions widely spaced in time, or else he might have entered them together but after copying the pavan on a page towards the end he looked back for a space for the galliard on empty staves which he found in the first few pages.</p><p><strong>JJ4a.</strong> NL-Lu 1666 (Thysius), f. 28r <em>Gailliarde</em>	p. 12</p><p><strong>JJ4b. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 1v<em> Galliard to the / flatt pauen</em>	12-13</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 92v untitled - first strain only</p><p>	GB-Lam 601, f. 5r <em>the galliard to the flat paui</em> [index: <em>the galliard to the same</em>]</p><p>	IRL-Dtc 408/I, p. 19 <em>The flat Paven Galliard The flat Pauen</em> - JohnsonB 14</p><p>Equal lute duet: JohnsonB 54</p><p>	GB-Lbl Eg.2046, f. 5v <em>the galyerd to the flatt pauion for ij luttes by Johnson</em> - I</p><p>	GB-Lbl Eg.2046, ff. 5v-6r <em>the galyerd to the flatt pauion for ij luttes </em></p><p><em>	by Johnsone</em> - lute II</p><p>Duet treble: JohnsonB 56 </p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.3.18, f. 22r <em>Galliard to the flatt pauen</em> - treble - no ground</p><p>Mixed consort: </p><p>	US-CA Mus.181, f. 2v <em>The galliard</em> - cittern part</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.5.20, f. 2r <em>Galliard to the flatt pauen</em> - bass viol part</p><p>A galliard in Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> published in Köln in 1603 (<strong>JJ5a</strong>) is concordant with <em>Jonsones gallyard</em> in the Willoughby lute book also found in three concordant and untitled settings without ascription in the Marsh lute book (<strong>JJ5b</strong>). From the dating of the sources to the 1580s and style it is assumed to be by John Johnson. It is unusual in being mainly confined to the upper four courses of the lute. Besard included divisions to the first two strains only with quite different figuration in places adding bass notes to the division to the second strain. He may have been following his exemplar or could have rewritten it himself. The first four bars are similar to the beginning of the third strain of a galliard ascribed <em>J.D.</em> in GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, f. 49v and assumed to be by John Dowland<em> </em>(DowlandCLM 27) so it is possible Dowland was quoting John Johnson unless it is just coincidence.</p><p><strong>JJ5a. </strong>Besard 1603, ff. 109v-110r <em>Galliarda</em>	p. 14</p><p><strong>JJ5b. </strong>IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13 (Marsh), p. 365 untitled 	15</p><p>	GB-NO Mi LM 16 (Willoughby), ff. 31r-31v <em>Jonsones gallyard</em> </p><p>	IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13, p. 90 untitled - JohnsonB 22</p><p>	IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13, p. 91 untitled 	</p><p>The country dance <em>Gathering peascods </em>set for violin is in John Playford's <em>The Dancing Master</em> of 1651 and all subsequent editions.<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> No text or reference to a ballad called <em>Gathering peascods</em> is known but the music is found in instrumental settings for lute, bandora and keyboard from the 1590s and later under several alternative titles. Quite similar settings are titled<em> The Gathering of pescodes</em> in the Board lute book (<strong>JJ6b</strong>) and <em>Brande Piscet</em> (<strong>JJ6a</strong>) (probably a corruption of the English title)<em>/ Chanson Angloise</em> in Valerius' <em>Nederlandtsche Ghedenck-Clanck</em> published in Haarlem in 1626. It is also called <em>Johnsons Toy</em> and <em>Jo Johnsons Allmaine</em> in three settings for lute or bandora (see <strong>JJ6c/d</strong>), so either John Johnson composed the tune that became a popular country dance with the title <em>Gathering peascods</em>, or he arranged music that was already popular. Either way he presumably intended it for lute and someone else then arranged it for bandora retaining the ascription to him. Regardless of who set it, the bandora arrangement, transcribed for lute here, is the best version. It is also known by yet another title, <em>Allins Jig </em>and although it is not in the style of the leaping dance of the jig it is assumed to refer to the famous actor Edward Alleyn (1566-1620,<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> and so may have been adopted as his signature tune when he appeared on stage, and he might even have danced to it. An association with the stage is suggested by the appearance of an untitled lute setting in D-B Danzig 4022, a manuscript of Gdansk provenance that probably includes English music brought by troupes of English actors who are recorded as visiting Gdansk between 1600 and 1619.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> All the versions for plucked instruments are edited in the <em>Lutezine</em> where it is treated as ballad/country dance tune. </p><p><strong>JJ6a.</strong> NL-Lu 1666, f. 456v <em>Brande Piscet.

Medleys comprise a series of unrelated dance-like movements or ballad tunes of different lengths and meter, the first few in common time followed by others in triple time (a structural form shared with typical masque dances!). Two sets for lute are titled medley, in some sources called old and new medley, one by John Johnson and the other anonymous but similar to the first and characteristic of Johnson's style and so probably also by him.<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> These two comprise sections in common and triple time, none using recognisable ballad tunes or country dances. It is a challenge to get the pace right to play these medleys and a slow beginning is necessary to accommodate the changes in meter, and Thomas Robinson's advice for playing lessons springs to mind:</p><p>'Therefore whensoeuer there is a lesson giuen you to play at the first sight.

The sources are all quite similar (except <strong>JJ7h</strong>) and share the same seven sections, three in duple and four in triple time. The Old Medley also seems to have been Johnson's most popular work on the continent represented by six sources, including settings in C, D and the only one known in F minor. These follow the English settings quite closely but mainly lack divisions and exhibit variable degrees of success in barring the second and third sections with their irregular rhythms punctuated with rests (as does the English source JJ7f), but all versions here have been edited to match each other.

However, the version in Adriaenssen's (<strong>JJ7e</strong>) is an unsatisfactory rendering that is quite different to the original. The B and C sections halve rhythm sign duration with two not four minims in a bar and the E and F sections are rather awkward in duple rather than triple time compared with the other sources.

A comparison of settings in different keys reveals the same melodic phrases appearing in different voices so they are not direct transpositions. Finally, one setting in F minor is unique to the Thysius lute book, with quite different figuration and only the first three sections in duple time (<strong>JJ7h</strong>), the melodies often at the same pitch as the settings in D minor. </p><p><strong>JJ7g. </strong>GB-AB 27, pp. 16-17 <em>Medley: J: J.</em>	26-27</p><p>	cf.

It is found in only three sources for lute all in C major, two English and the other in one of the prints of Matthäus Waissel, his second lute book published in Frankfurt in 1591 and in a second edition the following year, as well as one for keyboard and an orphan cittern part of a mixed consort setting. Three of the six sources call it new medley and one just the medley. The lute sources are concordant throughout, two English with divisions to all ten parts and nearly identical (see <strong>JJ8b</strong>). The continental setting is simpler, with divisions to only the fifth to seventh and tenth sections and different figuration and sometimes harmony in many places (see <strong>JJ8a</strong>), so either Waissel's exemplar was a different version or else he or his editor adapted it for inclusion in his print.</p><p><strong>JJ8a.</strong> Waissel <em>Tabulatura</em> 1591, sig.
