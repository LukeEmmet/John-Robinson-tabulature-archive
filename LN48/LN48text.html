<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 48 (December 1998): The Complete Lute Music of Raphael de Viola and two dances from the Johann Aegidius Berner Lute Book</strong></p><p>A book of lute solos by Raphael Viola [or Raphael de Viola] entitled <em>Raphaelis Violae Carminum pro Testudine liber, continens fantasia mutetas, Gallicas &amp; Italicas Cantiones</em> was published in Louvain in 1575, and probably reprinted in 1580,<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> probably by Phalèse and Bellère. However, no copies of either are known today. Fortunately, two stylistically similar fantasias ascribed to Raphael Viola survive and are reproduced here, giving a glimpse of this otherwise unknown composer. The first was published by Pierre Phalèse the elder in almost identical versions in three editions of his anthology <em>Theatrum Musicum</em> (1a-c). The second is in the Dlugoraj lute book [Leipzig, Musikbibliothek der Stadt, Ms.II.6.15, <em>c. </em>1619] (2a) and in Mertel’s <em>Hortus Musicalis Novus</em>, Strasbourg, 1615 (2b). The Dlugoraj version is quite different from Mertel’s, with many added notes and chords. It also has many rhythm signs missing or confused, which have been reconstructed here with help from Mertel. The fantasias may have appeared in the lost lute print of Viola, but note that Phalèse included one in three editions all predating Viola’s own print. Raphael Viola was presumably Italian, although the publication of his music in Louvain over a period of 17 years suggests he may have been resident in the Low Countries. He is not otherwise known, but may be related to the Della Viola family of musicians, including Alfonso and Francesco Viola, active in Ferrara <em>c.</em>1470-1570, or to Giovanni Domenicho Viola, a contem-porary Neapolitan composer.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>[Additional information: A Raphael Viola Bernardszn, 'marchier' from Cremona, became a burgher of Antwerp in 1558 and bought a house there in 1561. He probably married a Flemish woman named Grietken but no Antwerp marriage certificate.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> They had three children baptized in Antwerp, namely Dorothea in 1564, Petrus in 1566 and Lynken in 1568. Her family may have lived in England, since in 1567 Viola hastily travelled there to attend a court case over Grietken's parental estates. In 1569 he sold his house in Antwerp but nothing further is known about him. Nothing in the records refer to him as a lutenist or composer but maybe he was an amateur lute player who composed the two fantasias ascribed to him as well more music that was published by Phalèse in 1575.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>]</p><p>The lute books, one inscribed Johann Aegidius Berner von Rettenwert [Prague, Národní  Muzeum, Hudební Oddelení, Ms.IV.G.18, dated 1623 and 1627; 218 ff.] and the other from the library of Arnold Dolmetsch [Haslemere, Private Collection of Carl Dolmetsch, Ms. II.B.1, <em>c.</em> 1620;  285 ff.], are two huge manuscripts of 299 and 323 lutes solos, respectively. Aegidius is copied mainly in Italian tablature and Dolmetsch is all in French tablature, but their repertoire, largely courantes, voltes and galliards, is similar with 88 pieces concordant between the two. The two pieces reproduced here, one a marvellous anonymous chromatic galliard, and the other a courante by an otherwise unknown FRH, are typical of the high quality of the music in these manuscripts. </p><p><strong>1a.</strong> Phalèse, <em>Theatrum Musicum, </em>1563, f. 9r <em>Fantasia Raphael viola</em></p><p><strong>1b.</strong> Phalèse, <em>Theatrum Musicum</em>, 15687/1 <em>Fantasia Prima</em></p><p><strong>1c.</strong> Phalèse,<em> Theatrum Musicum Longe</em>, 1571, f. 12r <em>Fantasia</em></p><p><strong>2a.</strong> D-LEm II.6.15, pp. 42-43 <em>Fantasia Raph. de uiola 2</em></p><p><strong>2b.</strong> Mertel, <em>Hortus Musicalis Novus,</em> 1615, pp. 224-225 </p><p>	Phantasiæ et Fugæ <em>81</em>	</p><p><strong>3.</strong> CZ-Pnm G.IV.18, ff. 17v-18r <em>Galliarde</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong> CZ-Pnm G.IV.18, f. 28v <em>Courante F.R.H</em></p><p>	 GB-HAdolmetsch II.B.1, ff. 39v-30r <em>Courante FRH</em></p><p>		<em>John H.
