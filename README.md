Repository for John Robinson's files

Updated, with many subdirectories renamed to be consistent, on 8 December 2023

Each folder contains PDF files of the publication from which the files have been archived, 
plus Word (.docx) files of the text of the documentation, and .tab files containing
the TAB (Wayne Cripps) files from which the tablature was produced.
The documentation Word files are also included as .html files which can be used to create
useful metadata.

Sub-folders 'mei' and 'tc_files' contain MEI and TabCode versions, respectively, of the
tablature conveerted from  any .tab files present using Paul Overell's luteconv program.
