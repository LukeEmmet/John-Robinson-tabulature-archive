<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 140 (December 2021): A second selection of Toccate </strong></p><p><strong>plus settings of Padoana Le Forze de Hercule</strong></p><p><strong>Toccate</strong></p><p>The first selection of toccate were in the tablature supplement to <em>Lute News</em> 124 (December 2017) and included thirty-six  toccate from the earliest appearances of the title in 1536 to prints and manuscript up to the 1640s. In Grove Music Online the musicologist John Caldwell defined toccate as music 'intended primarily as a display of manual dexterity, often free in form'. The Italian verb toccare means to touch, consistent with toccate as practice exercises rather like the earlier forms of lute solo called Tastar de corde and recercare, as well as prelude, all implying 'warming up' exercises for lutenists. Although the surviving examples titled toccata (Tocata, Toccada, Toccata, Tochata, Tochatina, Tokata) are sometimes similar in style to lute solos titled prelude, recercare, fantasia and particularly passaggio,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> the form developed into a distinct genre characterised by a lack of melodic progression in favour of extended ascending and descending runs and sequences of arpeggiated harmonic progressions, those in the prints of Piccinini and Kapsberger the best known now.</p><p>This second selection comprises twenty two more that are either titled toccata or are similar in style but called prelude (T37/38, T45/46), fantasia (T49) or are untitled (T42, T52, T54-56), two also with the titles <em>Entrata</em> (T36) and <em>Fiminutio</em> (T50). The selection is brought together from fourteen printed and manuscript sources from Italy, Germany and France dating from the 1590s to the 1640s organised more-or-less chronologically.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> All but two are known from a single source each: T50 is also in Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> of 1603 and T54 shares material with an otherwise different fantasia in another source. Most are anonymous but some bear the composers names: the otherwise unknown Paulo d'Aragona Siciliano (T51), Amadie Maretti (T47),<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> possibly related to the Siena native musician Andrea Moretti who is known to have worked in Poland, Florence and Pistoia 1550-1610, the JB of T50 is presumably Jean Baptiste Besard, and Fil (T44) could be an abbreviation of a name. T39 is credited <em>dell'Autore</em>, that is Terzi in whose print it is found and T37 &amp; T38 from the published lute book of Reymann could have been composed by him, although T45/46 were almost certainly collected and not composed by Mertel. </p><p>Toccate including several here are a genre of lute music that presents problems in transcription due to frequently incomplete and inaccurate copying into the sources probably reflecting their improvisatory nature. The notation in manuscripts is often cursorily copied with bar lines incomplete or lacking entirely and rhythm signs either intermittently and inaccurately placed or absent altogether (a commentary of editorial changes is on p. ii and changes shown in grey in the tablature), although the presence of dots for right hand fingering in some sources is a useful guide to phrasing. The incomplete notation is a challenge to the editor attempting to reconstruct a playable version and may explain why few of them have found their way into modern editions or recordings. Incomplete notation is usually impossible to sight read and represents one circumstance in which an edited version in modern tablature is preferable to playing from facsimiles of the original sources of which plenty are now readily available. However, the readings in the original sources are open to interpretation and so could be reconstructed in multiple ways. The reconstructions here have attempted to impose regular barring to match seemingly strong and weak beats and cadences, despite the likelihood that the original intention reflected irregular phrasing more than a rigid structure with a steady beat. The toccate here range from little more than fingering exercises of shorter repetitive sequences (T42, T47, T56) or sweeping scaler runs across all the strings (T46, T50, T53) to those that are more episodic and structurally developed (T45, T55, T57) and others that are more like fantasias despite their titles (T51). So play them all - the best are at the end! The sources are copied in French, Italian or German tablature (see commentary) for six to nine course lutes and are all transcibed into French tablature here.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p><p><strong>T36.</strong> CH-Bu F.IX.70, p. 102 <em>XLVII.

All the distinct settings for lute and one for cittern are included here. Six settings are for lute solo in two different tonalities (C minor for F1, F2, F5, F7 and F minor for F4, F8 assuming a lute at G pitch). In addition one is a lute duet and another a lute trio: F3 is a duet for lutes a fourth apart and F6 a lute trio for lutes a fourth and fifth apart. The duet parts are also notated in C and F minor as they would sound on a G lute and the trio parts in C, F with a bass part G minor. Settings are in duple time except F8 and two of the cittern cognates are in triple time but nowhere are the two combined in one source as a paired dance. However F4 and F8 go together well as a pair and F5 is notated ambiguously with some bars in duple and others in triple time, so have been edited into a pair here (F5i/ii). </p><p>The tune is set to the passamezzo antico (p.a.) ground with scale degrees/harmony of i-VII-i-V-III-VII-i/V-I (F1) or more often the variant i-VII-i-V-i-VII-i/V-I (F2, F4, F5, F7-9). Curiously, neither the lute duet of Heckel (F3), nor the lute trio of Pacalono (F6) are playable as printed partly because the parts do not use the same form of the p.a. ground - and are not reconstructed here. Heckel's tenor part uses the variant p.a. ground for both statements of the tune but the discant uses the variant ground for the first statement and a different variant (i-VII-i-V-i-VII-III-I-I) for the second introducing harmonic clashes. The tenor is also found in the earlier lute duet book of Wecker (the discant book is lost) as well as amongst lute solos in the manuscript NL-At 208.A.27 - so one wonders how many other duet parts it includes. Pacalono's trio is corrupt and unplayable as printed so it is unlikely to have been a commercial succes. The three statements in both the superius and tenor parts of Pacalono are on the variant p.a. ground (concordances for both found as 'discantus' and 'altus' parts amongst lute solos in the manuscript PL-Kj W 510), except that the second statement in the superius and the third stement of the tenor uses a different variant ground of III-VII-II/i/VII/Vi-V-I-VII-i-V-I, and then the bassus part uses the usual p.a. ground leading to harmonic clashes between the parts in several bars. The notation of the tenor is also corrupt with errors in rhythm signs and consequent barring (see commentary) - although correct in the manuscript concordance. Fapp is from a print of Barbetta and both the opening melody and the title hint at a reference to Le forze de Hercule but comprises sections of four bars on a ground of I-VII-I-IV and so could be coincidence.</p><p><strong>F1.</strong> Abondante I 1546, sig.
