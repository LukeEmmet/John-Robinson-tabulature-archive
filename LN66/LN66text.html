Infamous, that is, because ‘The somewhat tarnished Lady Frances Howard, released from the bond of her match with the supposedly impotent earl of Essex, was soon to be the bride of the King’s favourite, the upstart Robert Carr, now suddenly the earl of Somerset’ (Sabol p. 578). There appeared ‘Harmony and nine musicians more, in long taffeta robes and caps with tinsel and garlands gilt, playing and singing’ (Sabol p. 24) and the performance included songs by John Coperario and Nicholas Lanier (Sabol p. 26). According to Sabol<em> Squires Masque</em> used the songs S20-3 (his numbered items); the antimasque dances included S98 &amp; 114, as well as n<sup>o</sup> 1 here, the devil’s dance (S138/277/278), ‘where according to an eyewitness - the fiends danced “a ballet of twelve devils” ’ (Sabol p. 581); the masque proper probably included ‘Squires Masque’ (S168), as well as very likely S60/279 for the entry dance, probably S136/280 for the main dance and S137/281 for the exit dance. <em>The Lord’s Masque</em> by Thomas Campion, performed on 14 February 1613 was one of three masques to celebrate the marriage of James I’s daughter Elizabeth to Frederick, Elector Palatine.  The other two for this occasion were George Chapman’s <em>Masque of Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn</em> on 15 February (cf. forthcoming tablature supplement for <em>Lute News </em>67) and Francis Beaumont’s <em>Masque of Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</em> on 20 February (cf. tablature supplement to <em>Lute News</em> 65). John Coprario was paid £20, Robert Johnson £10 and Thomas Lupo £10 for their contribution to this masque<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup>, from which it can be inferred that Coprario was the principal composer.  During the masque ‘Twelve Frantics enter at the sound of a strange musicke’, ‘in the middest of whom <em>Entheus</em> (or Poeticke furie) was hurried forth, and tost up and downe, till by virtue of a new change in the musicke, the Lunatickes fell into a madde measure, fitted to a loud phantasticke tune’.<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> Sabol has suggested that this<em> Lord’s Masque</em> used the songs S18 &amp; 19; S109 as a possible antimasque dance; the Lady Elizabeth of the title to n<sup>o</sup> 3b strongly suggests that n<sup>o</sup> 2a,b (S191/73/257) was the entry dance, n<sup>o</sup> 3 (S74/258/259) was the main dance and S75/260 was the exit dance to this masque; and possibly S125, 237, 238, 364, 392 &amp; 403 were amongst other dances used. Strains A &amp; B of the ‘first tune of the Lord’s Masque’ (S191 and first strain of n<sup>o</sup> 2a) were probably played when ‘the Eight Maskers appeared in their habits’ before the Torchbearer’s dance, separately from strains C &amp; D (S73 and n<sup>o</sup> 2b) which were probably played when ‘having everyone entertained his Lady’, they begin ‘their first new entring dance’ (Sabol, p. 567). Strains A, B and C, D are also separated in the principal source GB-Lbl Add.10444, strengthening the likelihood of two separate entries of the masquers. The title to n<sup>o</sup> 2a reflects the fact that Nicholas Confesse was the choreographer for the <em>Lord’s Masque</em>, paid £30 for his contribution.<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> Robert Taylor was probably a lutenist amongst the 54 musicians employed for the occasion, as he played the lute in the <em>Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn Masque</em> on the following night.<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Robert Spencer has suggested that n<sup>o</sup> 4, based on the ballad The Turtle Dove (S101/273/274) is possibly from <em>The Lord’s Mask</em>,<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> although Sabol and Brookes considered that it is from <em>The Mask of The Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</em>. N<sup>o</sup> 5, based on the ballad Now the Spring is come<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> (S94, titled <em>The second of the Lords</em> in GB-Lbl Add.10444) may possibly be from <em>The Lord’s Masque</em>, although Sabol has suggested this and S93, titled <em>The first of the Lords</em> in GB-Lbl Add.10444, are from another unidentified Masque of Lords. Musicians named in the accounts for this masque include ‘Jo: Coperary, Roberte Johnson, Thomas Lupo and Stephen Thomas‘ (Sabol, p.567) - and as S374 &amp; S378 are titled <em>Stephen Thomas his Almaine</em> and <em>Stephen Thomas his 2 Almaine</em> in GB-Lbl Add.10444, Sabol suggested that Stephen Thomas may have written them for this, or another masque in which he was involved. </p><p><em>The Masque of Flowers</em> was performed on 16 January 1614 by the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn at the Banqueting House at Whitehall for the Somerset wedding (see above). Peter Holman<sup><a href="#endnote-21" id="endnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> notes that ‘the text of the anonymous author recorded that "the loud music ceasing, the Masquers descend in a gallant march ... to the stage where they fell into their first measure", which implies that another ensemble - most likely the violins - took over from the wind instruments at that point’. And loud music sounds when a garden of a ‘glorious and strange beauty‘ displaces the antimasque scene.<sup><a href="#endnote-22" id="endnote-ref-22">[22]</a></sup> According to Sabol, the songs included S24; antimasque dances possibly included n<sup>o</sup> 9 &amp; 10 (S219 &amp; S220), the latter titled ‘Sommersetts Maske’, as well as S68, 126/282, 127, 128/283, 129, 130, 139, 167, 218, 232 &amp; 285/372; dances of the masque proper may have included the Gypsies Dance (n<sup>o</sup> 6, S99/286) as the entry dance, as well as S83/284, 84, 85/317 &amp; 100. Sabol suggested that the miscellaneous dances S393-400 &amp; 407-408, which include n<sup>o</sup> 7 &amp; 8 here, may also have been used in this masque. Brookes<sup>1</sup> (n<sup>o</sup> 1542) also suggested that the Gypsies dance (n<sup>o</sup> 6) is from <em>The Mask of Flowers</em>, but Robert Spencer argued that it is probably from Ben Jonson’s <em>The Gypsies Metamorphosed</em>, performed August-September 1621, commissioned by George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham (1592-1628), and for which Robert Johnson may have set ‘From the famous peak of Derby’.<sup><a href="#endnote-23" id="endnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup> </p><p>Ben Jonson’s <em>Masque of Augurs</em>, some of the music of which may have been composed by Alfonso Ferrabosco II (Sabol p. 25), was performed for James I on twelfth night, 6 January 1622, and repeated on 5 or 6 May, in a Banqueting House at Whitehall built by Inigo Jones sometime between 1619 and 1622. Sabol suggested that the songs included S32 &amp; S33, one by Nicholas Lanier, the antimasque dances may have included S69 and S70/297 (n<sup>o</sup> 12), the entry, main and exit dances of the masque proper are probably S61-S63. Robert Spencer suggested S64 (n<sup>o</sup> 11) is also from this masque<sup><a href="#endnote-24" id="endnote-ref-24">[24]</a></sup>, although Sabol (p. 566) drew attention to suggestive passages in the text indicating it may be from William Browne’s masque <em>Ulysses and Circe</em> (1615). </p><p>Also included here are a probable antimasque dance in F (n<sup>o</sup> 13) with similarities to the second of the Lord’s masques (n<sup>o</sup> 3a), two masque dances in G (n<sup>o</sup> 14 &amp; 15), one named after an unidentified ‘Lady Phillyes’, a mascarada in G (n<sup>o</sup> 16), and two further items in G, n<sup>o</sup> 17 probably a lute part from a consort setting of the Frog Galliard, and n<sup>o</sup> 18 titled My Mistress’ Farwell (stylistically related to n<sup>o</sup> 14), with no obvious connection with a masque. The fourth part in the series ‘Lute Arrangements of Masque Music’ to follow this one will include lute settings of masque music thought to be composed by Robert Johnson for Ben Jonson’s <em>Masque of Queen’s </em>(1609) and <em>Oberon</em> (1611), as well as<em> </em>George Chapman’s <em>Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln’s Inn</em> (1613). </p><p>	<em>John H Robinson, May 2003/ Revised February 2015</em></p><ol><li id="endnote-1"><p> Cognates: GB-Lbl Add.10444, ff. 40r &amp; 90v <em>The Diuells Dance </em>[treble/bassus, S138]; John Adson, <em>Courtly Masquing Ayres</em> (London, 1621), n<sup>o</sup> 10 untitled [à 5, S277].  <a href="#endnote-ref-1">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-2"><p> Cognates: GB-Lbl Add.10444, ff. 20r &amp; 74r <em>The first of the Lords</em> [treble/bassus, strains C, D, S73]; GB-Lbl Add.10444, ff. 54v-55r &amp; 104r untitled [treble/bassus, strains A, B, S191]; GB-Lam 600, f. 38r <em>Maske</em> [lyra viol, strains C, D]; William Brade <em>Newe ausserlesene</em> (Hamburg, 1617), n<sup>o</sup> 19 <em>Ballet</em> [à 5, S257]. <a href="#endnote-ref-2">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-3"><p> This item was included in the tablature supplement to <em>Lute News</em> 41 (March 1997): <em>The Complete Lute Solos of Robert Kindersley/Kennersley, Robert Taylor and Thomas Greaves</em>, n<sup>o</sup> 1 - to the inventory of which can be added a pavan and galliard <em>qd mastyre taylere</em> in the Dublin virginal manuscript (IRL-Dtc 410/II).

With regard to Confesse, Peter Holman (<em>Four and twenty Fiddlers</em>, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1993, p. 181), relates that “Two payments for Jonson’s <em>Oberon</em> (1 January 1610/11) show that Ferrabosco, Hearne, and ‘Monsieur Confesse’ were paid £20 each ‘for their paines having been imployed in the Princes Maske by the space of almost six weekes’, while [Thomas] Giles was paid £40 ‘for 3 dances’. A bill for a masque two months later, <em>Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly</em> (3 February 1610/11), clarifies the roles of some of the participants. Ferrabosco was once again paid £20 for ‘making the songes’, Confesse got £50 for ‘teaching all the dances’, and Bochan received £20 for ‘teaching the Ladies the footing of 2 dances’. In a less informative bill for Thomas Campion’s <em>The Lord’s Masque</em> (14 February 1612/13), Hearne and Bochan were paid £40 each, while Giles and Confesse received £30 each. Confesse is a mysterious figure: he does not seem to have been employed in any of the court households, and his first name is not given in most documents. But he was certainly a musician as well as a dancing-master, for the Board Lute Book contains an ‘Antiq Masque p<sup>er</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Confesso set by M<sup>r</sup> Taylor’ that may come from the Lord’s masque, and there is a corant ‘Confesse’ in US-NH Filmer MS 3; he is perhaps the ‘Nicholas Confais’ who was described as a musician of the Queen of England when he acted as godfather to Madeleine Vasser at the Paris church of Saint-Eustache on 13 May 1628, and the ‘Nicholas Confene’ who was described as a French musician lodging in the parish of St Martins-in-the-Fields on 16 December 1635. Significantly, there are three dances attributed to ‘Confais’ in the Tabley Lute Book at GB-Mr, a collection largely of French music compiled in England <em>c.</em>1661.” <a href="#endnote-ref-17">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-18"><p> See Robert Spencer, facsimile edition of the M.L. lute book (Clarabricken, Boethius Press, 1985), p. xxxi.  <a href="#endnote-ref-18">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-19"><p> Robert Spencer, facsimile edition of the Board lute book (Leeds, Boethius Press, 1985), item 157 of the inventory.  <a href="#endnote-ref-19">↑</a></p></li><li id="endnote-20"><p> See Claude M.
