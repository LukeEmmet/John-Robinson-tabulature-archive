<p><strong>Lute News 35 (September 1995): The Complete Lute Music of Mr. Lushier</strong></p><p>Any biographical references to Mr. Lusher or Lushier are completely lacking except for the use of his name in the ascriptions of two pavans and four almaines in seven of a total of nine different versions for solo lute in sources of English lute music. Four more lute solos seem to be ascribed ‘L’ and have also been included here, as they are in a similar style to the ascribed items and ‘L’ may be an abbreviation of Lushier. Versions of six of these pieces are found in three of the manuscripts copied <em>c.</em>1590-1600 by Matthew Holmes (GB-Cu Dd.2.11, GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, and GB-Cu Dd.9.33) when he was employed in Oxford and later Westminster Abbey. Thus Mr. Lushier was probably well known in mainstream English music circles at the end of the 16th century. The appearance of his music in the lute books of Richard Mynshall (GB-Lam 601, <em>c.</em>1597-9), Margaret Board (GB-Lam 603, <em>c.</em>1620-30) and Lord Herbert of Cherbury (GB-Cfm 689, <em>c.</em>1616-40), as well as in the Euing lute book (GB-Gu Euing 25, <em>c.</em>1620) and the Königsberg manuscript from the Brandenburg court in Prussia (LT-Va 285-MF-LXXIX, <em>c.</em>1620) also suggests an enduring and far reaching reputation. His music is tuneful and skillfully crafted, but is not clearly distinct from much of the lute repertory of the English Golden Age. This makes it likely that more of his music remains unidentified amongst the large body of anonymous lute solos in surviving English manuscripts.</p><p>Four of the pieces appear in modern editions (in Anthony Rooley’s <em>The Compleat Beginner</em> (EMCP, 1976), in the Boethius facsimile editions of the Board and Mynshall lute books, and the Orphée facsimile edition of the Königsberg MS), but all are brought together here for an appraisal and comparison of his extant output. Minor errors in the original sources have been corrected without comment.</p><p>The dedicatee of no. 10 could be either of two Barons Strange, additional titles of the Earls of Derby: Henry Stanley (1531-1593) 4th Earl of Derby and 12th Baron Strange or his son Ferdinando (1559-1594) 5th Earl of Derby and 13th Baron Strange. Both were patrons of the company of acrobats and actors known as Lord Strange's Men from the 1560s until their name changed to Derby's Men in 1593. Ferdinando was referred to as 'Ferdinando Lord Straunge' when he was summoned to parliament in the 1570s before he became the 5th Earl of Derby upon the death of Henry in 1593.</p><p>[Additional: all the sources of nos. 2, 4 and 6 as well as three more ascriptions to 'L' (nos. 8-10) have been added for the revision.]</p><p><strong>Worklist</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.9.33, ff. 13v-14r <em>A Pauen Lushier</em> </p><p>	3 strains of 9.5, 8.5 and 10 bars with divisions for the first 2 strains only, for 6-course lute</p><p><strong>2a.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 16r Pavan <em>Lushier</em> </p><p>	3 strains of 8, 9.5 and 9.5 bars without divisions and 7th course in D</p><p><strong>2b. </strong>GB-Cfm 689 (Herbert), f. 54r <em>Pauana</em></p><p>	3 strains of 16, 19 and 19 bars without divisions and 7th course in F and 8th in D</p><p><strong>3.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, f. 44v <em>Lushiers Allmaine</em></p><p>	3 strains of 8 bars with divisions and 7th course in D</p><p><strong>4a.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 60v <em>Lushers Allmaine</em></p><p>	4 strains of 8 bars with divisions to 2nd strain only for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>4b.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, f. 75r <em>Lushiers Almaine</em></p><p>	4 strains of 8 bars with divisions to 2nd strain only and 7th course in D</p><p><strong>4c.</strong> LT-Va 285-MF-LXXIX, f. 59v <em>Lusshers Allemande</em></p><p>	4 strains of 8 bars with divisions to 2nd strain only for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>4d.</strong> GB-Gu Euing 25, f. 20r untitled</p><p>	4 strains of 8 bars all with divisions to all strains and for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>5.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 10r Almaine <em>Lushier</em></p><p>	3 strains of 4 bars without divisions for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>6a.</strong> GB-Lam 603 (Board), f. 21r <em>M<sup>r</sup> Lushers Almayne</em></p><p>	3 strains of 8 bars with divisions and 7th course in F, 8th in D</p><p><strong>6b.</strong> GB-Lam 601 (Mynshall), ff. 10v-11r <em>Mr Lusher</em></p><p>	3 strains of 8 bars with divisions for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>Doubtful attributions:</strong></p><p><strong>7.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, f. 18r (almaine?) <em>L</em></p><p>	3 strains of 8, 9 and 8 bars without divisions for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>8. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, ff. 31v-32r (galliard?) <em>L</em></p><p>	2 strains of 8 bars with divisions for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>9. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.5.78.3, f. 29r (galliard?) <em>L</em></p><p>	4 strains of 8, 11 and 10 bars without divisions plus a 4-bar coda for 6 course lute</p><p><strong>10.</strong> IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13 (Marsh), p. 357 <em>Gall</em>(iard) <em>Lord Stra</em>(nge)<em>n L.</em>  4 strains of 4, 3 , 4 and 4 bars the first three with divisions for 6 course lute</p><p>	[Additional: no. 10 and other music dedicated to the Stranges was  edited for the <em>Lutezine</em> to <em>Lute News</em> 127 (October 2018)]</p><p><em>	John H Robinson - September 1995/revised August 2009</em></p>
