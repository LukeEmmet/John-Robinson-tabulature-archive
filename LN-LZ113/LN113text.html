It is not certain that he composed rather than arranged all of them and settings likely to be by others are consigned to the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>. All eight bear dedications, and several are found in the same few sources: ten in Mathew Holmes solo lute books (GB-Cu Dd.2.11, Dd.5.78.3 and Dd.9.33), three in Robert Dowland's <em>Varietie of Lute Lessons</em> of 1610), three in the Euing lute book (GB-Gu Euing 25), and four in the Folger-Dowland lute book (US-Ws V.b.280) of which one of the latter was copied (n<sup>o</sup> 53c) and another three signed (n<sup>o</sup> 47b, 66i-i &amp; 23b) by Dowland himself. A version of each can be heard on any of the complete Dowland recordings and most on YouTube.<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p><p>The <strong>Frog galliard</strong> (n<sup>o</sup> 23) is probably dedicated to the youngest son of Henri II of France, François de Valois (1554-1584) Duke of Alençon and Anjou. He was Elizabeth I's suitor from the early 1570s until 1582 and she is known to have called him her frog.<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Only one version (n<sup>o</sup> 23b) is ascribed to Dowland and in this version he signed his name after the title. He also composed the song <em>Now, O now, I needs must part</em> to the same music for his <em>First Booke of Ayres</em> published in 1597, although it is not certain that he composed the music rather than arranged an existing tune. At least two anonymous broadsides are also known that were sung 'to the tune of Frog's Galliard', <em>The True Lovers Knot Untied</em> and <em>The Shepheards Delight</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> The other four versions in English sources here, are different enough to cast doubt on whether they are Dowland's own settings, and the continental lute settings including two duets, plus a setting each for bandora and mandore and two for citterns, all in the <em>Lutezine</em>, are further anonymous diverse arrangements by others.</p><p>Two galliards and an almaine (n<sup>o</sup> 41 45 &amp; 53) are dedicated to <strong>Katherine Darcy</strong>, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Darcy. She married Gervase Clifton in 1591 and became <strong>Lady Clifton</strong> when he was knighted in or before 1597. Thus the dedication to K. Darcy in n<sup>o</sup> 41a, 45a and 53a suggests composition before 1591, and she had been Lady Clifton a decade or so when 45b was reused and dedicated to her as Lady Clifton in <em>Varietie</em>. N<sup>o</sup> 45a and 45b, the first ascribed to John and the second to Robert Dowland, probably a careless error in <em>Varietie</em>, are closely concordant but the latter adds elaborate divisions and a 7th course used just once. Only one of the three versions of n<sup>o</sup> 53 is ascribed, although another was copied incompletely by Dowland himself without adding a title or his name. Poulton conflated the A strain of this version with the B strain of the one in Dd.9.33, whereas all three versions are kept separate here. N<sup>o</sup> 53a and 53b are closely concordant except that the former includes divisions, whereas the version copied by Dowland, the A strain and its repeat only, are quite different especially the division, suggesting either that the divisions Dowland played varied over time or else that the divisions in Dd.9.33 were composed by someone else. The lute and solo cittern versions of n<sup>o</sup> 41 lack an ascription, but Dowland's name is found in the titles of the mixed consort parts (see endnote 3). N<sup>o</sup> 41b, concordant with 41a but including interesting variants, was re-dedicated to Queen Elizabeth in <em>Varietie</em> seven years after she died, unless earlier dedicated versions are now lost. The Queen's Galliard is titled and ascribed to Dowland in a source from <em>c.</em>1620 (n<sup>o</sup> 97b), but is also found anonymous and without dedication in one of Mathew Holmes lute books from the 1590s, so it was presumably composed during her reign.<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> The two galliards dedicated to Elizabeth I (n<sup>o</sup> 41b and 97) are different in character, the one she may have witnesses being performed, n<sup>o</sup> 97 in B flat is rather sombre and introspective, whereas the posthumously dedicated n<sup>o</sup> 41 in G major is bright and strident befitting the image of the queen as Oriana.</p><p>Diana Poulton was unable to establish any connection between the <strong>Shoemaker's Wife</strong> (n<sup>o</sup> 58) and the shoemaker's wife Mrs. Margery Eyre in Thomas Dekker's play <em>The Shoemaker's Holiday</em>, first performed in 1599 and again at court for Elizabeth I in 1600. So the dedication may only be an oblique reference to the popularity of folklore associated with the shoemaker's trade, which was gathered together in Thomas Deloney's novel <em>The Gentle Craft</em> published in 1597.<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> The two versions, n<sup>o</sup> 58b titled and ascribed  and n<sup>o</sup> 58a not, are closely concordant. The <em>Cobbler's Jig</em> is unrelated, but is a further nod to the shoemaker's trade and so all the lute versions are edited in the <em>Lutezine</em>.</p><p><strong>Smith's Almaine</strong> (n<sup>o</sup> 47) could be dedicated to either John Smith of Essex who was knighted at Royston in 1605, or John Smith of Ostenhanger in Kent who was knighted in 1603, both dates consistent with the dedication to<em> mr Smythe</em> in Folger copied <em>c.</em>1594 and <em>Sir Iohn Smith</em> printed in <em>Varietie</em> in 1610. Another possibility is Sir John Smith of Hough in Cheshire to whom Francis Pilkington dedicated his <em>Second Set of Madrigals</em> in 1624. The eleven known versions in English and continental sources reveal a variety of settings in two different keys. Only two are ascribed, one is in the Marsh lute book, and although largely copied in the 1580s is amongst a few pages of tablature that were added later, and the other version in the Folger-Dowland lute book to which Dowland signed his name after the scribe copied it. These two versions are quite different, but the one in the Folger-Dowland lute book is closely concordant with a version in <em>Varietie</em>, where it is curiously not ascribed to Dowland. It is possible he only arranged rather than composed it, and so only these three (n<sup>o</sup> 47a-c) are included here, and the rest are in the <em>Lutezine</em> as they are likely to be settings by others. Although a typical almaine with two strains of 8 bars with one set of divisions on each in n<sup>o</sup> 47c, and three sets of divisions in n<sup>o</sup> 47a&amp;b, it is unusual in that the divisions of the B strains do not repeat the first two bars, but instead repeat the second two bars twice over.</p><p>The tune of n<sup>o</sup> 66 was known on the continent as <strong>Rowland</strong>, O neighbour Robert or Soet, soet Robbertjen, named after characters in the most famous of all jigs, <em>Rowland and the Sexton</em> in three parts some or all written by Will Kemp. The second and third parts were registered in 1591 probably when they were printed and some years after they were first performed as it is likely Kemp took one or more to the continent in 1585 and 1586. No copies of an English text are known, but two German translations have survived.<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> The tune was known in England as <strong>Lord Willoughby </strong>to accompany a ballad beginning 'The fifteenth day of July with glittering spear and shield', dedicated to Peregrine Bertie (1555-1601) 11th Baron Willoughby of Eresby probably to celebrate one of his military successes as commander of the English forces in the Netherlands from 1585, and then his return to England in 1589.<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> Under the titles Lord Willoughby, Rowland or O Neighbour Robert the tune is also called for in a number of English ballads from the 1590s into the eighteenth century, and was also used for many Dutch songs.<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> A lute solo setting in C minor of the two 8-bar strains with divisions of the second strain only and all twice over (n<sup>o</sup> 66i-i) is ascribed to Dowland. A second unison lute part (n<sup>o</sup> 66i-ii) is also ascribed but Poulton considered it unlikely that Dowland composed this too. As several simple settings in D minor without divisions are also ascribed to Dowland (n<sup>o</sup> 66a, d &amp; f), it has been suggested that he wrote the tune. However, in addition to the closely concordant anonymous D minor versions n<sup>o</sup> 66b, c &amp; g, another concordant version with divisions is ascribed to Francis Cutting. Although Dowland may have composed the tune and the settings in both keys, it is also possible that he composed the tune but only made the C minor setting, and that his name became associated with the D minor settings which were by Cutting. Otherwise, both Dowland and Cutting may have arranged an existing tune. William Byrd made an elaborate keyboard setting, which is also found in the Pickeringe lute book transcribed for lute by an unknown composer. The latter, plus Thomas Robinson's and another anonymous English arrangement, together with all the known continental lute settings by Hausmann, Hove, Vallet and anon, and versions for bandora and cittern can be found in the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>.</p><p>The <strong>Coye Toy</strong> (n<sup>o</sup> 80) should have been included in <em>Lute News</em> 112 as it is a version of <strong>Mrs. Vaux's Jig </strong>(n<sup>o</sup> 57), so is added here as an addendum. The dedicatee was probably Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Roper, who married George Vaux (1564-1594), son of William (&lt;1535-1595), third Baron Vaux, of Harrowden in Northamptonshire. George pre-deceased his father so did not become Baron and Elizabeth remained Mrs. Vaux. </p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 23, 41, 45, 47 and 58 all include shifts between duple and triple time, or between 3:4, 6:8 or 9:8 rhythms, and so gridiron rhythm signs have been used for one version of each (as well as n<sup>o</sup> 53) to clarify the rhythms. App 1-3 are page fillers of three ballad tunes that include reconstruction of two fragments from the Folger-Dowland lute book, and a consort part that seems to carry the tune.</p><p><strong>Daniel Bacheler's Fantasia<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup></strong></p><p><strong>Daniel Bacheler</strong>'s Fantasia is known only from the unique copy in the Herbert of Cherbury lute book,<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> but after the scribe copied it, a different hand, which Christopher Morongiello suggested could be that of Daniel Bacheler himself from whom Herbert could possibly have had lessons,<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> annotated it adding dotted rhythms, crossing out notes and substituting seven bars towards the end.
