<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 125 (April 2018): John Dowland Part 26 - The Fantasias (JD1-7, 71-74 &amp; 101) - settings of Calleno casturami and The Hemp-Dresser</strong></p><p><strong>&amp; Daniel Bacheler's variations on Fin de Gailliarde (DB42)</strong></p><p><strong>John Dowland fantasias</strong></p><p>My first tablature supplement was a selection from one of Hans Newsidler's prints for <em>Lute News</em> 26 in April 1993 and I have produced four a year since so that this is my hundredth.<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have chosen the pinnacle of the English Golden Age, the complete fantasias of John Dowland: JD1-7 and the doubtful attributions JD71-74 plus JD101.<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> One version of each is included here (not always the same one as in DowlandCLM) and all the other versions have been edited for the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>. We now know of ten sources for JD1, six of JD6, five of JD3, four of JD2, three of JD7, two of JD4 and one of JD5, and the doubtful attributions JD71-74 and the dubious JD101 are known from one source each, except two of JD71. All the English versions are found in eight manuscripts (the earliest Dd.5.78.3 copied <em>c.</em>1595-1600 and the latest the ML lute book <em>c.</em>1616), apart from the version of JD1 in Robert Dowland's <em>Varietie</em> of 1610.  Mathew Holmes' manuscripts are represented, with versions of JD3 in Dd.5.78.3, JD2, 4, 6, 7 &amp; 73 in Dd.9.33 and JD6 in Nn.6.36. However, there are none in Dd.2.11, which does include forty-three other Dowland pieces distributed throughout the manuscript, as well as twenty-eight other fantasias so Holmes did not seem to be avoiding them. This together with the dates of the other sources (see above and below), and the fact that versions of all the fantasias are for a lute with a seventh course tuned to D (or an 8th or 9th tuned to D in a few cases), suggesting that Dowland composed fantasias, those that survive at least, relatively late in his career. The continental prints date from 1615 and 1622 and the manuscripts from after 1592 for the Lvov MS and <em>c.</em>1620 for the Loss lute book, and the concordance between continental and English sources is not surprising considering Dowland spent so much time abroad. There are nearly as many versions in continental manuscripts and prints as there are in English sources, and all versions are closely concordant but with a scattering of apparent errors and a fascinating diversity of minor variants that reward close study: the range of variant readings add another dimension to the edited and sometimes conflated single versions (two of JD1) in DowlandCLM.<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Mathew Holmes' short hand notation of rhythm in his last two lute books also led Poulton to comment that 'in the writing of the time marks the scribe has left many ambiguous passages'. Thus, Poulton missed the significance of the dots above staves without rhythm signs as indicating dotted rhythms, which have been incorporated here (see versions of JD2, 4, 6, 7 &amp; 73 in Dd.9.33 and Nn.6.36). Sometimes the variants are viable alternatives or even correct apparent errors in the English versions including those in DowlandCLM (e.g. JD71), but other variants are less satisfactory. However, as well as correcting obvious errors, I have retained variants that are probably not errors in an attempt to preserve a diversity of readings (details in the critical commentary at the end of the <em>Lutezine</em>). A discussion of the origins of some of the themes of the fantasias and their possible influences, as well as the doubtful attributions have been published by Diana Poulton, John M. Ward and Paul O'Dette.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Details of the fantasias known from more than one source can be found in the <em>Lutezine</em> and are discussed there, but the unique version of JD5 as well as JD72-74 that are not titled or ascribed and unique to a single source are briefly described here. JD5 is untitled and begins with what seems to be a 6-bar strain of a pavan that is similar to Dowland's Lady Russell pavan (JD17) and one of his Galliards (JD34). JD72 includes both ascending and descending chromatic hexachords unlike Dowland's chromatic fantasias although it is placed amongst a series of other Dowland works. JD73 follows a Dowland fantasia and begins with a theme reminiscent of the ballad tune <em>All in a garden green</em>,<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and JD74 begins with the same theme as JD1, but lacks the characteristic structural unity of Dowland.<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> All three doubtful works have Dowland characteristics so he may have composed them but they could be imitations by others. JD101 is ascribed but is out of character and may only be a pale reflection of a genuine Dowland work.</p><p><strong>JD1.</strong> GB-Lbl Add.31392, ff. 13v-14v <em>A fantasie. / </em></p><p><em>	Maister Dowland</em> - DowlandCLM 1	3-5</p><p>	#B-Bc Littera S 26.369, ff. 19r/19v/17r untitled (bars 67 to end)</p><p>	#D-Dl 1.V.8 (Loss), ff. 7v &amp; 43r <em>Fantasia Joh.

A ballad by John Alde called 'Callin o custure me' was entered in the Stationers Register in 1582,<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> which may refer to song n<sup>o</sup> 14 in Richard Jones's <em>Handefull of Pleasant Delites</em> of 1584, 'A Sonet of a Louer in the praise of his lady. To Calen o Custure me: sung at euerie lines end' beginning 'When as I view your comly grace, Calen o Custure me, Your golden haires, your angels face, Calen o Custure me'.<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> The tune was called for in an unrelated ballad, 'A pleasant Song made by a Souldier, whose bringing up had been dainty ... To an excellent tune, called, Calino' (EBBA 20034 c.1630; 21708, 1663-74 &amp; 31024, 1658-64).<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Two settings are here and another six in the <em>Lutezine</em>.</p><p>article on Ian Pittaway's website</p><p><strong>C1.</strong> IRL-Dtc 408/II, p. 85 <em>calleno</em>	11</p><p><strong>C2.</strong> J-Tn BM-4540-ne, sig.

The lute setting in Board is in the transitional tuning known as English Gauthier (and transcribed for renaissance lute here). I have not found the origin of the title in the Board lute book, but Playford's titles come from the poem called 'The Hemp Dresser' beginning 'There was a London gentlewoman, That lov'd a country man-a, And she did desire his company, A little now and then-a. This man he was a hemp-dresser, And dressing was his trade-a, And he did kiss the mistress, sir, And now and then the maid-a' with a 'Fa la' refrain, published in 1685 as song sixteen of <em>Latine songs with their English, and poems by Henry Bold; collected and perfected by Captain William Bold</em>,<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> but presumably known much earlier. The tune was also called for in a ballad by Charles Blount published <em>c.</em>1679 called 'The Sale of Esau's Birth-right; OR, The New Buckingham Ballad, To the Tune of the London Gentlewoman, or Little Peggy Ramsey' (the latter an alternative tune; versions of which were edited for <em>Lute News</em> 121) (See EBBA 32166, 33819, 33820, 34366, 34367, 35144, 35145, 35146, 34915, 35143, 35534; and Bod596,<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> Bod6347, Bod13594 - RoudV8173). <em>The Hemp-dressers</em> is also mentioned as a popular tune in <em>A Second Tale of a Tub or The History of Robert Powel, the puppet-showman</em> published in 1715.<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> The tune is also called for in Thomas D'Urfey's <em>A Third Collection of New Songs</em> 1685, 'The <em>Winchester Christening,</em> the Sequel of the <em>Winchester</em> Wedding: A new Song, set to the Tune of a pretty Country Dance, called, <em>The Hemp-dresser</em>' beginning: 'The Sun had loos'd his weary Team, and turn'd his Steeds a grazing'.<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> This song is also in also in D'Urfey's <em>Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> 1719 (vol. I pp. 320-322) and many 18th-c Ballad Operas, usually calling the tune <em>The sun had loos'd his weary team</em> from D'Urfey's song text although others call it <em>Jone stoop'd down</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Robert Burns' song 'The Deil's awa wi' the Exciseman' is to the same tune.<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup></p><p><strong>H1a.</strong> GB-Lam 603, f. 38r <em>hemp and flax or tedro</em> - lute (edeff)	28</p><p><strong>H1b.</strong> GB-Lam 603, f. 38r <em>hemp and flax or tedro</em> - transcribed	28</p><p><strong>H2.</strong> Playford <em>DM</em> 1651, p. 58 <em>The London gentlewoman Or the hemp </em></p><p><em>	dresser</em> / <em>The London Maid</em> - arranged from violin melody	28</p><p>	= GB-Lbl Add.29371, f. 44v <em>Hemp Dresser</em> - violin; Walsh 1718, p. 219 <em>161 Hemp Dresser</em> - violin</p><p><strong>Daniel Bacheler Fin de Galliard</strong></p><p>The Bacheler series continues with his set of fifteen variations (DB42) on the continental galliard known as Fin de Galliard and used at the end of suites of dances as a represa.
