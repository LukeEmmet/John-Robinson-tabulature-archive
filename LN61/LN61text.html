<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 61 (April 2002): Lute Music Associated with Thomas Morley </strong></p><p>This supplement marks the 400th anniversary of the death of Thomas Morley (1557/8-1602)<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> by including all the known solo lute music associated with him, amounting to three pavans and three arrangements of the music from his ballett <em>Now is the Month of May</em>[<em>ing</em>], although lute versions of another pavan-and-galliard pair are lost. The three lute pavans survive in consort or keyboard arrangements and are unlikely to have been composed for the lute. No. 1 is a pavan ascribed to Morley in Robert Dowland’s <em>Varietie of Lute Lessons</em> (London, 1610). It is a lute intabulation of a pavan à 5, although the surviving five part version was arranged by Peter Philips, and Ferdinando Heybourne, alias Richardson, made the keyboard setting (see worklist below). It is not known who made the lute arrangement, but it is possible it was Robert Dowland in whose lute book it was published.</p><p>No. 2 is the Sacred End pavan, the title of which is presumed to refer to the point of imitation in the third strain based on <em>I lift my heart to thee</em> by Christopher Tye [1505-?1572].<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> None of the seven lute settings, nor the continental arrangement for five instruments, are ascribed to Morley, but the mixed consort version bears his name in Philip Rosseter’s <em>Lessons for Consort</em> (London, 1609).<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The accompanying galliard is ascribed to John Baxter by Rosseter, and may have been arranged by Baxter from Morley’s pavan. Rosseter claims in his 1609 print that the contents of his <em>Lessons</em> were ‘by mee Consorted’, that is he arranged existing music for mixed consort, including Morley’s Sacred End pavan. It was not new at the time of Rosseter’s edition as the two lute solos in English sources are dated <em>c</em>1595 for Trumbull [no. 2b] and <em>c</em>1600 for Dd.9.33 [no. 2a]. These two versions are similar to each other whereas the cognate versions in continental sources represent quite different settings, and so all seven are reproduced here. The version in Eijsertt [no. 2d] is also unusual in that the triple time section is in F major whereas all the other versions remain in a minor key.</p><p>No. 3 is a direct transcription for lute, transposed down a tone, of the pavan from a pavan-and-galliard pair ascribed to Thomas Morley in the Fitzwilliam virginal book.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The lute solo is titled <em>A pauan Mr Birde set to lute by fr. Cutting</em>, and the lute divisions are different to those in the keyboard version and so were presumably composed by Cutting. Nigel North has suggested that the attribution to Morley is probably correct on stylistic grounds as well as the position amongst other pieces by Morley in the keyboard source, and hence the ascription to Byrd is probably an error.<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The pavan begins with the theme from John Dowland’s Lachrimae pavan, and the second strain is based on the same imitative passage that is found in the second strain of the <em>Pauana Douulant</em> in Mylius’s <em>Thesaurus Gratiarum</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> This passage is also similar to the opening of the second and third strains of Morley’s pavan in <em>Varietie</em> [no. 1].</p><p>Nos. 4 &amp; 5 are a pavan and galliard pair for solo lute that were included in Morley’s <em>First Book of Ayres</em> of 1600, but are unfortunately missing from the only extant copy, in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C. The pavan and galliard may have been lute versions of one of the keyboard pavan-and-galliard pairs in the Fitzwilliam virginal book, one of which is a version of Southernes pavan and galliard.<sup><a href="#endnote-7" id="endnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Their appearance in Morley’s book of lute songs suggest that he may have composed or arranged them for the lute himself. </p><p>Apart from the three pavans, this supplement includes three lute solos in continental sources [nos. 6a-c] that are anonymous arrangements of Morley’s ballett <em>Now is the Month of May</em> (or <em>Maying</em>),<sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> also arranged for mixed consort by Rosseter<sup>3</sup>, and as a lute song in Add.15117 to the words of Campian's <em>The peacefull westerne winde, y<sup>e</sup> wintrye stormes hath calmed</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The settings in F and G in the Königsberg manuscript follow the original two strains closely, but the one in Leipzig II.6.15, also in G, transcribed from the German tablature here, is only recognisable from the first strain and then strays from the original quite considerably. Interestingly, version 6b. is related to the lute song setting in 15117, whereas 6c. is closer to the five part ballet version.</p><p>Morley published several books of, or about, music,<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> including his <em>First Booke of Consort Lessons</em> of 1599 [with a posthumous second edition in 1611<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup>], although it is not known whether he made the mixed consort arrangements himself. However, it is assumed that he wrote the lute accompaniments to the songs in his <em>First Booke of Ayres</em> of 1600, and he may also have made the lute intabulations of the lower parts of his <em>Canzonets or Little Short Aers to Five and Sixe Voices</em> of 1597. He also quoted from contemporary lutenist composers, such as John Dowland, in lute pavan no. 3 as discussed above, and he used the beginning of John Johnson’s pavan in Dd.2.11, f. 44v, <em>A Pauen/ Jo: Johns</em>[on] for the words ‘I am the resurrection’ and the harmonies of ‘Man that is born of woman’ in <em>The Service for the Burial of the Dead</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Worklist</strong><sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Pavan</strong> [3 strains, in G minor, 7th-c in D]</p><p>	<em>Pavan. 3 / Composed by the excellent Musition Thomas Morley Batcheler of Musicke, and Organist in the Chappell of the most Sacred Elizabeth, late Queene of England, &amp;c.</em>	Dowland 1610, sig.

The title <em>Allemande à Globe</em> of one version in Königsberg, also used for an unrelated piece on f. 6r in the same manuscript, suggests the scribe or his sources associated the music with performances at the Globe theatre in London, or performances in the Königsberg region by travelling English theatre companies who also performed at the Globe theatre. The title <em>Feines Lieb du wirst nachkommen</em> to the other version of <em>Now is the Month</em> is probably an error as it refers to an unrelated setting of this German text by Hassler. <a href="#endnote-ref-17">↑</a></p></li></ol>
