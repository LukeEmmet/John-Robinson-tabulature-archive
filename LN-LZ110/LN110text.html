A biography of Robert Johnson (<em>c.</em>1583-1633) can be found in part 1, and his music is well represented in recordings.<sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Two modern editions have been published, the first edited by Albert Sundermann in staff notation with facsimiles but no edited tablature, and the second a version of each without critical commentary edited by Rainer Luckhardt.</p><p>The Fantasia opens with a theme repeated in bars 1, 2, 4, 11 &amp; 13 that probably derives from a vocal model although it has not been identified.<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Lord Herbert of Cherbury copied the three lute pavans, but quite unusual for him, the two that have divisions are incomplete with errors as well as missing rhythm signs and absent or misplaced bar lines in places, reconstructed here mainly based on Sundermann. All three are also in the ML lute book, only one of them with divisions. The versions are closely concordant but ML includes a lot of playing indications including ornaments whereas Herbert is plain tablature. Another pavan survives only as a keyboard transcription, almost certainly of an original lute solo, and Nigel North was kind enough to provide staff notation for his lute transcription of it (which he plays on his Robert Johnson CD) and so tablature is included here. The two lute galliards survive in many concordant versions (eleven for n<sup>o</sup> 6 &amp; seven for n<sup>o</sup> 8). One English and one continental version of each plus one ascribed to John Dowland [DowlandCLM83] are reproduced here and the remainder in the <em>Lutezine</em>. A third galliard (n<sup>o</sup> 4) for lyra viol is included both as the original for lyra viol tuned 'Alfonso way' as well as in my transcription for 7-course lute. Finally, the Coranto is the only example of the genre ascribed to Robert Johnson.<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p><p>	<em>John H Robinson June 2014</em></p><p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 110 (July 2014): The complete settings of lute solos by John Dowland - Part 11: n<sup>o</sup> 83 Galliard &amp; n<sup>o</sup> 106 Monsieur's Almaine</strong></p><p><strong>Worklist<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup></strong></p><p><strong>1.

The ascribed version is one of the manuscript additions to a copy of Jean Baptiste Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> published in 1603 now at the University of Genoa (n<sup>o</sup> 106b) comprising an A section of 16 bars followed by a B section of 8+8 bars all twice over. Three concordant but anonymous versions are known in English manuscripts: one untitled and anonymous in Dd.2.11 (n<sup>o</sup> 106a) adding a further two varied AB sections making four in all. It seems likely that all four were composed by Dowland, assuming the ascription in Genoa is correct. The Wickhambrook manuscript also includes a concordant setting (n<sup>o</sup> 106c), but only of the opening A section and the first 8 bars of the B section. Interestingly, in the course of editing all the versions of Mounsieur's Almaine, I discovered that what was assumed previously to be a lute part in Mathew Holmes' consort and duet manuscript Dd.3.18, is in fact nearly identical to the last AB section of the version in Dd.2.11. Nordstrom had previously commented that the Dd.3.18 setting did not match the other consort parts in the Holmes part books or the consort parts in Thomas Morley's <em>Book of Consort Lessons</em> (1599/R1611), and that it was added later to the manuscript and omitted from the index.<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> So it now seems Holmes copied an incomplete Dowland lute solo into his lute part book. </p><p>An anonymous setting from the Marsh lute book (copied <em>c.</em>1580s) is probably the earliest known setting, included here as n<sup>o</sup> 1, the first of the other settings for lute, bandora, cittern and lyra viol all of which can be found in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>. This and a ballad licensed in 1588 by Thomas Deloney called 'A ioyful new Ballad, Declaring the happie obtaining of the great Galleazzo' to the tune of 'Mounseurs Almaigne'<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> suggests that Dowland, and the others to whom variation sets are ascribed, wrote the variations on a pre-existent tune from earlier in Elizabeth's reign. As for the title, it was customary to refer to the King's brother as Monsieur, and so the almaine could have been named after François, Duke of Anjou (<em>b.</em>1555-<em>d.</em>1584), brother of Henry III of France (reigned 1574-1589), in view of François' courtship of Elizabeth I from 1579.<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> Alternatively, 'Mounsieur Simpkin' was one of the sobriquets of the actor and dancer Will Kemp (<em>d.</em>1603),<sup><a href="#endnote-21" id="endnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> in which case the composer of the original tune could have written it for Kemp at any time in his stage career. </p><p>DowlandCLM 83 is a version of a galliard ascribed to Robert Johnson in four of the eleven lute settings, and dedicated to Lady Mildmay in one of the remaining versions that are all anonymous (all reproduced here in <em>Lute News </em>110 and the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>). The version ascribed to Dowland is so closely concordant to those ascribed to Johnson that a separate setting by Dowland seems unlikely so that the ascription to Dowland is probably in error. </p><p>As an addendum to <em>Lute News </em>109 (April 2014), here is a slightly revised version of Dowland's <em>Loth to Depart </em>(DowlandCLM 69), because my final pdf mistakenly included a version without edits from DowlandCLM correcting a few errors in the original, and I since found minor omissions of my own (listed in the commentary). </p><p><em>	John H.
