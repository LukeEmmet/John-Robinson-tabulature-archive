He was probably the father of five children named Collard in records of baptisms in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, and maybe of Edmund son of Edmund &lt;<em>sic</em>&gt; [1592] at St. Andrews in Holborn. He was probably the Edward Collard who witnessed a bond signed by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1585.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup></sup> Court accounts show that John Johnson was paid as one of 'the three lutes' to Elizabeth I from 1579, and when he died in 1594 his place remained vacant until temporarily filled by Edward Collard in 1598-9. Collard is not mentioned after the accession of James I in 1603, and must have died before 1604, when his place was taken by Robert Johnson.<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>Collard’s music, all in English manuscripts, comprises three Pavans, three Galliards and three sets of variations, the latter on the ballad tunes As I went to Walsingham and Go from My Window, and a Ground.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></sup> Christopher Morrongiello has suggested that the ascription ‘Edmund’ to n<sup>o</sup> 6 could refer to his son [the Edmund born 1592?]. The Pavan and Galliard n<sup>o</sup> 3 and 4 form a pair dedicated to Anthony Mildmay, probably the country gentleman from Apethorpe in Northamptonshire (<em>d.</em>1617), eldest son of Sir Walter Mildmay (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Mary Walsingham (sister of Sir Francis Walsingham). He was ambassador to Henry IV of France in 1597 and his portrait hangs in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, which his father founded. The title of the Pavan calls him ‘Mr.’ and so was presumably composed before he was knighted in 1596.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-7" id="endnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> It is not known what Maye refers to in n<sup>o</sup> 7. </p><p>				<em>John H Robinson, February 2013</em></p><p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 105: Complete settings of lute solos by John Dowland part 6: Dowland’s First Galliard [22] and Phantasia [101] plus an appendix</strong></p><p>Here are a Phantasia [DowlandCLM n<sup>o</sup> 101]<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[8]</a></sup> and a Galliard [DowlandCLM n<sup>o</sup> 22] in the series of complete versions of lute solos of music by John Dowland. The Phantasia is ascribed Dooland, presumably John Dowland, and a single version is known, in Philip Hainhofer’s lute book.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[9]</a></sup> Poulton thought that this and another two items in the same manuscript ‘although possibly derived from compositions by Dowland, are hardly convincing in the form in which they appear in this MS’. </p><p>Five lute versions of the Galliard [n<sup>o</sup> 22a-e], two ascribed to Dowland, are known and found exclusively in English manuscripts. In addition, ascribed settings for solo cittern [n<sup>o</sup> 22f] and mixed consort with parts for cittern, recorder and bass viol are known, other parts to make up the usual mixed consort [bandora, treble viol], presumably now missing. The mixed consort setting bears the title <em>Dowlands first galliarde</em> suggesting it was an early composition, possibly the first galliard Dowland composed. Three lute versions were copied by Mathew Holmes into Dd.2.11, one of them the only version with divisions. All 5 lute versions are quite closely concordant, n<sup>o</sup> 22b and 22c especially close to each other. However, the handling of the final strain in n<sup>o</sup> 22a-d is awkward and seems to have been revised in n<sup>o</sup> 22d-e, the former near the end of Dd.2.11 and the other in the later Board MS and both with a 7th course in D. A <em>Galliarda Gregorÿ</em>, presumably by Gregory Huwet, is based on Dowland’s Galliard and found in a large German lute manuscript and in Johan Rude’s <em>Flores Musicae</em> of 1600, included here as n<sup>o</sup> 22g-h.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[10]</a></sup> The first strain is the same as Dowland’s Galliard, the second strain is different, and the third strain is similar to Dowland’s although shortened from 10 to 8 bars by omitting repeats of bars 1, 3 &amp; 5 and using a different final 3 bars. John M. Ward quoted DowlandCLM n<sup>o</sup> 22 as an example of the extent to which different versions of the same music either transmit variants of Dowland’s compositions or represent arrangements by others. He concludes than none of the surviving versions can be directly linked with Dowland and that n<sup>o</sup> 22b &amp; 22c are probably consort parts.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[11]</a></sup> </p><p>In the facsimile edition of the Mynshall lute book, Robert Spencer suggested that <em>Mrs Jane Leightons choyce</em> was similar in style to music by either John Dowland or Francis Pilkington, and so it is included here as an appendix to the works of Dowland. Although a Jane Leighton is not found in the records, she might be a member of the family of Sir William Leighton (1565-1622), poet and composer who published <em>Teares or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soule</em> in 1614, to which Dowland contributed.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[12]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Worklist<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[13]</a></sup></strong></p><p><strong>22.

Each variation has A and B sections of 4 bars each in the pattern AB or ABB which is why variations are either 8 or 12 bars in length and explains the irregular placement of double bar lines, reproduced here as in the originals. Thus 5a has 4 variations of 8/12/12/12 bars and the same 4 variations (with minor variants) plus 3 additional variations of 8/12/12 bars are added to 5b and 5c, which are concordant between the two. <strong>5a. </strong>23/4 - f5 added. <strong>5b.</strong> 4-5 - ‘2’ written above bar line; 8-9 - grey notes and rhythm signs obscured by damage to manuscript; 14/6 - a4 added; 33/5 - e3 crossed out and f4 added later in original; 38/3-4 - an attempt at correction obscures b3 and d4; 39/3 - c4 and c5 crossed out; 50-51 - bar line absent; 60/1-4 - 8 quavers c1a4?-d1-f1-d1-a1-c1-d1-a1 overwritten with 4 crotchets d2a4-d1a2-c1d3-a1b3 in original; 60/5 - c1d2a4? overwritten with d2d3a4 in original; 67/2-3 &amp; 6-7 - grey notes obscured by damage to manuscript. <strong>5c. </strong>ornaments and right hand fingering dots added and there are many minor variants compared with n<sup>o</sup> 5b; 67/1-2 - quavers changed to semiquavers; 69/11-12 - crotchet quaver changed to 2 quavers. <strong>6. </strong>47-48 - bar line 2 notes to the left. <strong>7a. </strong>no changes. <strong>7b.</strong> ornaments and right hand fingering dots added, otherwise strains closely concordant to n<sup>o</sup> 7a with some variants. <strong>7c.</strong> no changes. <strong>8. </strong>11/15 - c2 changed to e2; 19/1 - crotchet absent; 41/10-11 - bar line added; 42-43 &amp; 43-44 - bar line 8 notes to the left; 44-45 - bar line 12 notes to the left; 45-46 - bar line 13 notes to the left; 47-48 - bar line absent. <strong>9a</strong>. the two versions also differ only in minor variants at 47/8, 55/1, 59/7, 100/5 or 9 and 103/1; 12/5 - b2 instead of a2; 19/1 - f2 added; 27/1 - a2 absent; 41/1 - dot to crotchet crossed out; 43/4 - a2 crossed out; 66/11 - c4 unclear; 92/4 - d4 instead of d3. <strong>9b.</strong> Grey notes and rhythm signs (plus the dotted minims which I cannot grey in TAB) in bars 1-7, 12-14, 22-23, 32, 100-102, 106-107 and 112 are obscured by damage to the manuscript (although the few interspersed black notes are visible) and have been reconstructed here from n<sup>o</sup> 9a; 21-22 - bar line absent; 35/5 - c2 written over a2 in original; 89/3 - e4 unclear.
