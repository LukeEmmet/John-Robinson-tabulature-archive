Jacob's preludes and fantasias are diverse in style as well as range of keys so that it is difficult to recognize characteristic traits, suggesting he was a versatile composer unless more of the attributions are in error than the few that we know of (see below).</p><p>The Herbert manuscript is by far the major source of Jacob's music (40 of the 60 or so pieces and all but three of those here). Curiously in Herbert thirty are ascribed to <em>Jacob</em> and another ten to <em>Polonois</em>, and none of titles of the concordances confirm that they are the same composer. However, the two names are linked in Hove's <em>Delitiae Musicae</em> of 1612 with four pieces ascribed <em>Jacques Pollonois</em>, so it seems likely that Edward Herbert collected the music without realising they were by the same composer, whom he would not have met because Jacob died in 1605 before Edward was first in Paris as James I's ambassador in 1608. Besard included ten pieces ascribed to <em>Jacob Reys</em> in <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus </em>of 1603 (including <strong>F2</strong> here), also assumed to be the same composer. One fantasia here (<strong>F19</strong>) is also ascribed <em>Polonois</em> in a manuscript of German provenance and now in Bautzen, which presumably refers to Jacob. Another fantasia (<strong>F5</strong>) unique to Fuhrmann's <em>Testudo Gallo-Germanica</em> of 1615 ascribed <em>Pollac</em> is also assumed to be by Jacob in the modern editions of Szczepanska and Pozniak. But it is the only work in Fuhrmann's print to use the name <em>Pollac</em>, and his list of composers in the preface includes separate entries for <em>Sig. Iacob</em> and <em>Sig. Polonos</em> - similar to the separate Jacob and Polonois ascriptions in the Herbert manuscript, see below. F5 could be by Jacob, but Fuhrmann might also have meant another lutenist from Poland, such as Kasper Sielicki<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> or Petrus Konopacky,<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> but not Diomedes as Fuhrmann entered <em>Diomedes Venetus</em> separately in his list of composers.</p><p>Unusual for the lute,<strong> F15</strong> and <strong>F16</strong> are in the key of A minor or plagal Aeolian mode ending on the dominant.<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Bars 35-38 of F16 are corrupt in the original and retained in the Pozniak edition, but I have reconstructed it (details in the commentary at the end of the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this<em> Lute News</em>). Also, in <strong>P10</strong> the barring misses the strong beats from bar 25 to the end of the original, which I, and Pozniak, adjusted editorially by changing the first two notes of bar 25 from quavers to crotchets and then moving bar lines by a crotchet from then on. Only one source of each of the preludes and fantasias here are known, except for two of the fantasias: the two sources of <strong>F5 </strong>are nearly identical but the minor variants in Mertel, sometimes better readings such as in bars 11-12. The ascribed version of <strong>F19 </strong>in the Bautzen manuscript is corrupt in the first stave resulting in incomplete polyphony which seems correct in Mertel. The alternative versions of these two are in the accompanying <em>Lutezine</em>. Two fantasias in Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> are ascribed <em>Jac. Reys</em> but both are concordant with fantasias in Melchior Neusidler's <em>Il Primo Libro </em>published in Venice in 1566 and the title page confirms that Melchior composed them,<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> suggesting Besard's ascriptions of these two (and who knows how many more in his print) were in error. They are included in the <em>Lutezine</em> as fantasias of Melchior. Also, <em>Fantasia Augusta</em> from the Thysius lute book is included as a doubtful attribution to Jacob here (<strong>App 1</strong>). In the table of composers in the preface to Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em>, copied in Philip Hainhofer's lute books (D-W Guelf.18.7/18.8) as well as in Gumpelzhaimer's <em>Gymnasma</em> of 1621, Jacob is referred to as 'Iacobus Reys Augustanus' and in <em>Varietie of Lute Lessons</em> Robert Dowland includes a fantasia 'Composed by the most famous Jacobus Reis of Augusta'<em> </em>(F4 in <em>Lute News</em> 126) - suggesting an association of Jacob with Augsburg. None is known and it seems more likely to be an error confusing him with Melchior Neusidler who was in Augsburg, maybe similar confusion to Besard's misattributions above.</p><p><strong>Wakefield on a green</strong></p><p><strong>WG1. </strong>Morlaye <em>Le Second Livre de ...

John Ward identified the same tune in a set of eight variations for gittern, printed in Paris for Guillaume Morlaye in 1553.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <em>Wakefild on a greene</em> is also the title of a set of three variations on a similar four-bar ground but with a different melody for keyboard in the early seventeenth century Wray manuscript (GB-Lbl Add.30485). Morlaye's setting is transcribed for lute here and John Johnson's treble and ground duet and a lute transcription of the keyboard tune are in the <em>Lutezine</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> 'Wakefylde and agrene, a ballett' is entered in the Stationer's Company Register for 1557/8 (Rollins 2829) soon after publication of Morlaye's gittern setting, suggesting the tune was known in England as early as the mid-sixteenth century. The earlier ballad was probably reworked as 'The jolly Pinder of Wakefeild' registered a century or so later in 1675 (Rollins 1308),<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> as this entry presumably refers to broadsides from the 1680s headed 'The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield with Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John To an excellent Tune' beginning 'In Wakefield there lives a jolly Pinder in Wakefield all on a Green' (EBBA 20721, 30380, 33341, 33347, 33349, 35499, 35981 - <a href="http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu">http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu</a>). The earlier and/or later ballad was probably accompanied by one or both of the two tunes above. Wakefield is a cathedral city in West Yorkshire recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, becoming a centre for the woollen and tanning trades in medieval times. It was the location of the Battle of Wakefield in 1480 during the Wars of the Roses and a Royalist stronghold in the Civil War (1642-1651). A pinder or poundmaster was a local government official in charge of a pound for stray livestock, and the story is about a pinder challenging Robin Hood and his men who 'Dare make a trespass to the town of Wakefield' (line 7 of the ballad).<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Trenchmore</strong></p><p><strong>T1. </strong>GB-Cu Nn.6.36, ff. 30v-31r untitled	22-23</p><p><strong>T2.</strong> US-Ws V.b.280. f. 87v untitled	23</p><p><strong>T3. </strong>US-Ws V.a.159, ff. 10r-10v &amp; 12r <em>Trenchmore</em> 	25</p><p><strong>T4. </strong>Playford 1651, p. 103 <em>Trenchmore </em>- arr from violin	25</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.3.18, ff. 12v-13r <em>Trenchmoore Jo: Johnson </em>- duet treble = GB-Lcm loan 2019-01 (formerly WPforester welde), ff. 11v-12r <em>Trenchmore</em> - duet treble and ground = IRL-Dm Z.3.2.13,(Marsh), pp. 139-141 untitled - duet treble and ground - JohnsonB 66.

The title may refer to an Irish dance from a place called <em>An Trinse Mór</em> or Trenchmore in the barony of Kells, county Kilkenny and the site of the <em>Shanna-chushlawn-Threenshamoore</em>, or old castle of Trenchmore, no trace of which now survives.<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> The music is a 4-bar dance tune with a strong alternating tonic-dominant rhythm but less than memorable tune of rising and falling scalar phrases. The lute solos that survive are fragmentary settings in the lute book inscribed Giles Lodge from the 1560s (T3) and the Folger Dowland lute book from the 1590s (T2) and a highly accomplished set of eleven variations in Mathew Holmes' last lute book from <em>c.</em>1605-1615 (T1)<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> in addition to a treble and ground duet by John Johnson (in the <em>Lutezine</em>). A setting is also found in the later section of the Pickeringe lute book in the transitional 'Gaultier' tuning edeff and the keyboard manuscript probably compiled by Robert Creighton (F-Pn Rés.1186) both from <em>c.</em>1630. It is also found in the mid-seventeenth century Boteler and Ridout cittern manuscripts and Playford's <em>The Dancing Master</em> of 1651, and into the eighteenth century in the Balcarres lute book copied <em>c.</em>1695-1701 in baroque lute tuning (dfedf) and as a melody for violin in Walsh's <em>The Compleat Country Dancing Master</em> of 1718.</p><p>Trenchmore is extensively quoted in contemporary literature, the first known in the records from Loseley Park near Guildford of the charges &amp; expenses for the wardrobe of the Lorde of Misrule at the court of Edward VI in 1550/1, of 'Appareil ... made for: his daunsers: thre garmentes of sarsenett with iij payre of sloppes of owde store for them that daunsed trenchemore the makinge besides the stuff ... iij<sup>s</sup>',<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> and it is referred to periodically thereafter until the early decades of the eighteenth century:<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> William Bulleyn <em>A Dialogue both pleasaunte and pietiful</em> <strong>1564</strong> 'He plaieth tricke upon the Gitterne, and daunce Trenchemore and Hey de Gie, and telleth newes from Terra Florida'; Raphaell Holinshed <em>Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</em> <strong>1577</strong> 'these iapes and gibes are onelie fit for ruffians, vices, swashbucklers &amp; tosspots.

So in our Court, in Queen Elizabeth's time, Gravity and State were kept up. In King James time things were pretty well But in K[ing] Charles time there has binn nothing but Trenchmore &amp; the Cushion dance, <em>omnium gatherum</em>, totty polly, hoyte come toyte'.</p><p>Although the tune is not called for by name in surviving broadside ballad sheets, Thomas Ravenscroft <em>Deuteromelia</em>, 1609 includes settings of two 'Freemens Songs to 4. Voices' to the tune without naming it: 'Tomorrow the Fox will come to towne' (No. XX) and 'Willy prethe goe to bed' (No. XXI), the latter also in Thomas D'Urfey <em>Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> 1699-1714, pp. 51-52 with the music. However, the political song 'A New Ballad: To the Tune of Trench-more' beginning 'What do Members now ail, To the King to turn Tail' in Thomas Tebb &amp; Thophilus Sanders' <em>Poems on Affairs of State</em> vol. III 1704/R1716 (p. 139/124 - free Google e-book), might be expected to have used it but it lacks the music and the words do not fit the tune here. Also, the broadside entitled 'The West-Country Jigg: Or, A Trenchmore Galliard' calls for 'a Merry Scotch Tune, Or, Up with Aley Aley' beginning 'Jack's a naughty Boy, for calling his mother wh[ore]' which is different music,<sup><a href="#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> but the text of verse two 'Four-and-twenty lasses went over Trenchmore Lee' and the final verse of twelve 'And wish that Trenchmore Lasses they may live merry and long', does seem to confirm that Trenchmore was a place.<sup><a href="#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Whetelies wheatsheafe</strong></p><p><strong>WW1. </strong>Robinson SoM 1603, sig.

It is different to the dance tune in triple time for violin titled <em>Blue petticoats or Green Garters </em>in John Playford's <em>The Dancing Master</em> first published in 1651. Both of these are different to the tune called for in the broadside ballad headed 'The Longing Shepherdess: or, Lady lie neer me.

Both the song book and the galliard are dedicated to Sir Robert Sidney (1563-1626), who was knighted in 1586, became Lord Chamberlain to queen Anne of Denmark, James I's wife, in 1603 and created Viscount Lisle in 1605 (so it is curious that Robert Dowland still refers to him in the table of contents only as Sir Robert Sidney in <em>A Musicall Banquet</em> five years later). It is closely related to the anonymous <em>Susanna Galliard </em>(<strong>JD91</strong>) found in Matthew Holmes first lute book copied <em>c.</em>1588-1595 which is presumably an earlier version of JD38 composed by Dowland. He also reworked it into a galliard for consort, no. 19 in his <em>Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares</em> published in 1604 where it is dedicated to <em>M. Bucton</em>. The identity of the dedicatee is uncertain, but he may be the courier named Buckton referred to in a letter from Paris dated 1582 to Principal Secretary Sir Francis Walsingham from Sir Henry Cobham, Elizabeth I's French Ambassador whom Dowland was with in Paris.<sup><a href="#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28">[28]</a></sup> A close concordance for JD91 titled <em>Susanne</em> is found in the lute book of Emanuel Wurstisen from Basel copied <em>c.</em>1594-1615,<sup><a href="#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29">[29]</a></sup> and a cognate lute setting is titled <em>Gall</em>(iard)<em> Susanne</em> in a German manuscript now in Nürnberg copied <em>c.</em>1615-20,<sup><a href="#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30">[30]</a></sup> and an arrangement for instrumental ensemble is in Füllsack &amp; Hildebrand <em>Außerlesener Paduanen und Galliarden Erster Theil</em> published in 1607, <em>XVIII</em>[b] <em>Galliard à 5 Ihon Douland</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31">[31]</a></sup> The titles are a clue to the fact that the galliard is a pastiche of music from Orlando de Lassus' setting of the poem <em>Susanne un jour</em> by Guillaume Guéroult (1507–1569) based on the biblical story of Susannah and the Elders. It was originally set by Didier Lupi Second (<em>c.</em>1520-&gt;1559) and later adapted by Lassus, as well as Cipriano de Rore, Gerard van Turnhout, Claude Le Jeune, and Eustache Du Caurroy. The appearance of Dowland's galliard on the continent also suggests it may have been part of the music used in the play <em>Susanna</em> written by Henry Julius (1564-1613) Duke of Brunswick and staged at Wolfenbüttell in 1593 by the English actors Robert Browne and Thomas Sackville.<sup><a href="#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32">[32]</a></sup> John Ward first described the extent of the material Dowland borrowed, and Peter Holman commented that 'nearly every note [of the the consort setting] comes from Lassus'!<sup><a href="#footnote-33" id="footnote-ref-33">[33]</a></sup> Dedicating it to two different people and publication of this galliard entirely based on borrowed material, is a credit to Dowland's ingenuity! DowlandCLM included the galliard <strong>JD76</strong> as 'anonymous but probably by Dowland' because 'The opening phrase ... is the same as that of (JD)19, 'Pipers Galliard' and many of Dowland's characteristics of composition are present in the piece (no examples given). In addition to the stylistic indications its position in the Euing MS, between (JD)3 Farwell and (JD)72, might also point to Dowland as composer.' However, Poulton's caveat to another doubtful attribution is apt: 'It is, however, all too easy for an author to lay claim to most of the attractive anonymous pieces for his, or her, particular composer!' Poulton considered the <em>W th</em> in the title of one version, reminiscent of the title of JD50 <em>Mrs Whites Thinge</em> (edited in <em>Lute News</em> 100), to be a scribal error or confusion. The two sources both lack divisions and differ in the figuration of the opening bar as well as minor details, both versions included here for comparison. JD82 and JD84 are included in DowlandCLM as 'attributed to Dowland, probably incorrectly'. The ascription of <strong>JD82</strong> to <em>F Cutting</em> is added in the usual location for titles in Holmes' lute books below the final double bar line, and <em>Dowland</em> is written more hastily by Holmes, probably later, in the centre of the bottom margin of the page. Both DowlandCLM and Burgers' Cutting edition attribute it to Cutting. <strong>JD84</strong> is a lute setting of a galliard for instrumental ensemble in Anthony Holborne's <em>Pavans, Galliards, Almains ... in five parts</em> published in 1597. Poulton considered that 'there is no reason to doubt that Holborne is the original composer. If Dowland is connected in any way with this piece it can only be as arranger for the lute' and John Ward added that 'Mathew Holmes ... may have ascribed it to Dowland because the melody of the first strain is very like that of the latter's Sir John Souch's Galliard' (JD26 - edited in <em>Lute News</em> 103). Judging the version in Hirsch to be 'very inaccurate; the divisions are undistinguished [I disagree!] and the bass is frequently inconsistent with the bass of the statement' DowlandCLM reproduced the version in Dd.9.33 which lacks divisions. The Hirsch setting with divisions is here and the one in Dd.9.33 is in the <em>Lutezine</em>. The dedicatee may be Thomas Haselwood who signed a letter to the Cecils from Colchester in 1595.<sup><a href="#footnote-34" id="footnote-ref-34">[34]</a></sup> <strong>JD104</strong> was new to the third edition of DowlandCLM after John Ward identified <em>Ga 7 Dowland p</em> <em>Ro Sp</em>, a Dowland galliard arranged for cittern by Robert Sprignell, in the Otley cittern book as a cognate for two anonymous lute solos and one for bandora. A lute setting in G with divisions is in the Hirsch lute book, and another a tone lower plus a bandora solo, both lacking divisions are in Holmes' first lute book Dd.2.11. The two lute settings are here and cittern and bandora settings, together with a repeat of the lute setting in F with the addition of divisions transposed from the setting in G are in the <em>Lutezine</em>. Of these six galliards, all but JD84 begin with rising figures, albeit with different intervals and at different pitches. The page filler <strong>App 2.</strong> is anonymous and follows <em>Susanna Galliard</em> (JD91) in Dd.2.11; the third strain is like the third strain of Dowland's song 'Come againe, sweet loue' no. XVII in <em>The First Book of Songes</em> 1597 and the lute solo JD60 (edited for <em>Lute News</em> 121). </p><p><strong>English Clock Dance</strong></p><p><strong>K1. </strong>D-B N 479 (Grühenbühel), f. 68r <em>Ballet</em>	p. 27</p><p>	US-R Vault M 140 V186S (Sibley), p. 37 <em>Chanson anglese</em></p><p>	Valerius 1626, pp. 150-151 <em>d‘Engelsche klocke dans</em> - lute, cittern, voice</p><p>	Starter <em>Friesche Lust-hof </em>1621, p. 44 <em>D‘Engelscbe Kloke Dauns</em> - song</p><p>Amongst the tunes Adriaen Valerius adopted to set songs in his <em>Nederlantsche Gedenck-Klanck</em> of 1626 is one called <em>d’Engelsche klocke dans</em>, which is also used to accompany dozens of songs in Dutch song books between 1621 and 1757.<sup><a href="#footnote-35" id="footnote-ref-35">[35]</a></sup> However, I can find no source of music from England or literary reference to a contemporary English clock dance. Valerius' setting is rather crude, and more satisfactory lute solos on the tune are found titled <em>Chanson anglese</em> and <em>Ballet</em> in two manuscript sources - one included here and the other with Valerius's setting in the <em>Lutezine</em>. A different tune with the Swedish title <em>Engelska klockan</em> (English clock) is found in a number of Swedish sources (two for lyra viol, five for keyboard and one for cithrinchen), none for lute but one for lyra viol transcribed for lute in the <em>Lutezine</em>. </p><p><strong>Addendum</strong> to <em>Lute News</em> 129.<sup><a href="#footnote-36" id="footnote-ref-36">[36]</a></sup></p><p>		<em>John H.

Rimbault, in Gutch's <em>Robin Hode, </em>1847, Il, 434, reprinted as the tune of 'The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield' the 'Baily's Daughter' music from <em>The Jovial Crew. </em>Rimbault did not mention the ballad opera but named as the source of his tune 'an old MS. in lute tablature, formerly in the collection of the Rev. Mr. Costling, of Canterbury'. What he called 'another copy of this tune' in Cambridge University MS Dd.3.18 is evidently 'Wakefilde on a green' f. 11v, an entirely different air. Its title, coming from the burden of 'The Jolly Pinder' probably led Rimbault to an association which the music does not justify."
