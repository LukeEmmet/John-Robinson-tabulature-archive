<p><strong> Music supplement to Lute News 65 (March 2003)</strong></p><p><strong>Lute Arrangements of Maske Music, Part 2: Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</strong></p><p>This tablature supplement is the second in the series of lute arrangements of masque dances and includes four dances that Sabol<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> suggests could have be associated with the <em>Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</em> of 1613.  The Board and M.L. lute books, which contain much masque music, are the sources for several versions of these. Also included are Mr. Goodwell’s masque for St. John’s College Oxford, an otherwise unknown ‘mask’ from a continental source, and, as an unrelated filler, a set of variations on a simple ground. </p><p>In the reigns of James I and Charles I the masque reached its peak of development and a great deal more is known about the fifty or so masques by Ben Jonson and others performed at court and elsewhere<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> than about any of the Tudor masques, particularly as many Stuart masque texts and contemporary accounts of performances survive.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>  From these texts the sequence of masque and social dances interspersed with song can be deduced. Masques usually began with one or more antimasque dances and songs performed by professionals, followed by loud music announcing the ‘discovery’ of the scene of the masque proper. Then came the entry of the masquers, who were courtly or even royal amateurs, coached by professional dancing masters. This first entry dance was followed by the main dance of the masquers (second entry dance) and the revels (third entry dance), when the masquers ‘took out’ selected members of the audience to dance. These three sets of dances were each followed by a song, and the proceedings were concluded by the exit (or last entry) dance of the masquers.  The texts also provided clues that have been the basis for the often conflicting attempts of Sabol and others to identify the music for particular masques<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup>, and in virtually all cases this remains highly speculative although it is easier to predict whether dances were used in the antimasque or the masque proper. </p><p>With this caution in mind, lute settings are included here of four dances that may have been used in Francis Beaumont’s <em>Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s Inn</em> performed at Whitehall on 20 February 1613<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup>, one of three masques celebrating the marriage of James I’s daughter princess Elizabeth to Prince Frederick, Elector Palatine.  From the published description of the performance, we learn that ‘The perpetual laughter and applause was above the music’ (ll. 241 <em>et seq.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup>), which included amongst other consorts a group of twelve lutes.  Sabol ascribes the masque dances to John Cooper, alias Giovanni Coprario, probably in error.<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The masque included two antimasques, the first described by Howes<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> as ‘an Anti-Maske of a strange, and different fashion from others, both in habit and manners’ in which various characters danced in succession, and ‘At their comming, the Musicke changed from Violins to Hoboyes, Cornets, &amp;c. And the ayre of the Musicke was utterly turned into a soft time, with drawing notes, excellently expressing their natures, and the measure likewise was fitted unto the same, and the Statues placed in such several postures, sometimes all together in the Center of the daunce, and sometimes in the foure utmost Angles, as was very gracefull besides the noveltie: and so concluded the first Anti-masque’ (ll. 173 <em>et seq.</em>). Howes called the second antimasque ‘a rurall countrey maske consisting of many persons, men and women, being all in sundry habits and manners’. For Sabol’s candidates for the first antimasque, see Sabol 402-6 and my no. 1 (Sabol 155/270/271), and the second antimasque, Sabol 192, 204, 354-61 and my nos. 2-4 (Sabol 152/255/256, 123/272 &amp; 221), as well as Sabol 103 and 104/269. For suggestions for the first entry dance, see Sabol 101/273/274; and the second entry or main masque dance, Sabol 102/275. The third entry dance or revels is known to have included galliards, corantos and durets<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup>, which are impossible to identify from the sources.  Finally, for a possible exit dance, see Sabol 186/276.  It should be emphasised that the assignment of most of these is very speculative and does necessarily agree with the assignments made by others, although my nos. 1 and 2 seem to be the most secure. </p><p>The lute versions of no. 1, in two different keys, are quite accurate. The title of 1 iii may refer to James I’s Queen, Ann of Denmark who died in March 1619. It seems less likely that the music predates Beaumont’s masque and refers to the death of Elizabeth I.  1 iv is set a fifth higher, with bass courses indicated with numbers 1/2/3/4 in the source.  The versions of no. 2 are also in two different keys and are for ten course lute, except the version in Lady Margaret Wemyss’ lute book, although ten courses are used in other items in her book. The rhythm signs in versions of no. 2 are quite confused in places and have been altered editorially to make more satisfactory settings. Sabol rather tenuously associates the title of no. 3 with Beaumont’s own description of the second antimasque as ‘a May-daunce or Rurall daunce, consisting ... of a confusion, or commixture of all such persons as are naturall and proper for Country sports’, and he suggests no. 4 could have been used in the second antimasque for the dances of the He-fool and the She-fool mentioned in the text. I have no additional information on the Mr. Goodwell of no. 5, or of masques performed by or for St. Johns College, Oxford.  No. 6 sounds familiar but I have been unable to identify it from other sources.	</p><p><strong>Worklist:</strong> [all included in <em>Masque and Stage Music for Renaissance Lute</em> (Lute Society Music Editions 2020)]</p><p><strong>1.
