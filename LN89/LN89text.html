His son, Alfonso Ferrabosco the Younger (1575-1628), became an influential composer of mask and viol consort music during the reign of James I.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p><p>Versions not used in previous editions of Alfonso’s music have been edited here, and the surviving bandora fantasias (one ascribed to Richard Allison in one source) have been transcribed for renaissance lute.<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Only one item (n<sup>o</sup> 2) is known from his consort music, suggesting these solos were composed for the lute or bandora, and then only one survives in both lute and bandora versions (no 1a &amp; b), the remainder set for one instrument or the other. His fantasias are intabulated across the entire tessitura of the instruments, some of those for lute predominantly in a lower register (n<sup>o</sup> 4 and 5a &amp; b) exploiting the sonority of the lower courses, whilst others, notably the bandora solos, are set in a high register reaching the 12th fret and above on the first string (n<sup>o</sup> 10, and 6 - the latter transposed down a minor third here to avoid use of a 14th fret). N<sup>o</sup> 1, 5 and 8 survive in different keys, both versions included here. It is possible that the versions in higher keys were either originals or transcriptions for bandora and those in lower keys for lute, leaving one wondering which instrument each was composed for and which is the transcription? The versions of n<sup>o</sup> 1 in foreign prints of Mertel and Mylius are closely concordant with the English sources, and the multiple versions of n<sup>o</sup> 4 are closely concordant, as are those of n<sup>o</sup> 3, although the later printed version adds a 7th course and has some significant variants largely simplifying the fingering. The quite different versions of n<sup>o</sup> 3 and 5 in Besard <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> of 1603 are the only other Alfonso fantasias known from continental sources. Additions to previous editions are the incomplete fantasia [n<sup>o</sup> 9] with one or more bars missing at the right hand end of each stave indicated as |:| and at the end, but not reconstructed here,<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and a lute solo which John Ward thought ‘Resembles Ferrabosco’s fantasia Vt re mi fa sol' [see n<sup>o</sup> 2] - although the similarity seems obscure.<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p><p>		<em>John H.
