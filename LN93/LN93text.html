<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 93 (April 2010): Anonymous English Pavans and Galliards</strong></p><p>A lot of English lute music is unascribed in the surviving sources leading to it being overlooked in favour of music by named composers, most of whom have now been served well by modern editions. However, some of the anonymous music is of a very high standard and this tablature supplement brings together eight pavans, five galliards, and other music that falls into this category of neglected lute solos lacking ascriptions. Some of these bear similarities to the music of known composers such as Anthony Holborne [see n<sup>o</sup> 4, 12 and 16], Francis Cutting [see n<sup>o</sup> 6] and John Dowland [see n<sup>o</sup> 9, 19 and 21], although it is equally likely that these great composers would have influenced the music of other composers who then imitated their style and traits, so it would be hazardous to attempt to assign any attributions here. </p><p>The eight pavans are found in seven different manuscript sources including three of Mathew Holmes’ manuscripts of lute solos, in chronological order Dd.2.11 (8 items), Dd.5.78.3 (7 items) and Dd.9.33 (2 items), mainly copied in the 1590s. Six of the pavans [n<sup>o</sup> 1, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 21] are for 6-course lute, and the remaining two [n<sup>o</sup> 3 and 13] require a 7th-course tuned in D (assuming a lute in G pitch). N<sup>o</sup> 1 and 11 (the latter not in Holmes’ manuscripts but concordant versions are found in three other sources from the 1590s) seem to belong to the earlier generation of composers contemporary with John Johnson, the rest typical of the English Golden age. </p><p>The five galliards [n<sup>o</sup> 4, 6, 12, 15 and 20] are all for 6-course lute. N<sup>o</sup> 20 is probably the earliest based on style and the fact that the source is dated 1583. The third strain of n<sup>o</sup> 6 quotes the ballad tune known as the woods so wild,<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and n<sup>o</sup> 4 is from the Thysius lute book, a continental manuscript that contains English music. </p><p>The Russell dedications of n<sup>o</sup> 15 and 21 are not very legible in Dd.2.11 probably explaining why they were not included in inventories of Dd.2.11.<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The dedicatee of the galliard n<sup>o</sup> 15 is probably John Lord Russell (<em>d.</em>1584), son and heir of Francis Russell, second Earl of Bedford (1527-1585); as he predeceased his father he did not accede to the earldom. In 1574 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke of Gidea Hall, Essex, and she is therefore Lady Russell and likely dedicatee of the pavan n<sup>o</sup> 21 here, and of John Dowland’s Lady Russell’s pavan.<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>The fancy [n<sup>o</sup> 19] is like a pastiche of features reminiscent of fantasias of John Dowland and n<sup>o</sup> 17 is a fine set of five 16-bar variations over a ground or tune in the bass with the chord sequence F-C F A-Bb-C F / G-A Bb-C-D G G / Bb Bb F F / C-A-Bb-C D-C F F. </p><p>The spaces on the pages have been filled with shorter anonymous pieces including two jigs [n<sup>o</sup> 10 &amp; 18], two versions of a farewell [n<sup>o</sup> 2 &amp; 14], an almaine [n<sup>o</sup> 16], a piece called <em>Rose</em> [n<sup>o</sup> 8] and an untitled piece [n<sup>o</sup> 22]. The farewell [n<sup>o</sup> 2 &amp; 14] may have been written on the death of John Chidley or his wife (one dedication seems to be to him and the other to her?), or to celebrate his departure with Andrew Meyrick from Plymouth with three ships in 1589, a disastrous voyage that probably ruined the Chidley family.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It is not known to what <em>Rose</em> refers, but it seems to have the characteristics of a maske or music for a theatrical performance, and could refer to the theatre called The Rose, built in 1587 by Philip Henslowe and a grocer named John Cholmleyor. Alternatively, it could be a reference to a ship, such as the famous Mary Rose named after Henry VIII’s sister, launched at Woolwich in 1515 and sunk by a French galley in 1545, but predating another famous ship, H.M.S. Rose built in Hull in 1757. However, if this were true, the definite article would be expected to precede the title.</p><p>The similarity of bar 55 in n<sup>o</sup> 17 [variations] and bar 12 of n<sup>o</sup> 5 [pavan] probably reflects the use of a common devise of lute figuration but may also point to the same composer.</p><p><strong>Worklist</strong> minor editorial changes made without comment</p><p>1.
