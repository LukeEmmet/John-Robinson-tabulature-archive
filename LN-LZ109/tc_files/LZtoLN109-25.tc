{ 2d. Canon: Sing with thy mouth - arranged for lute }
{ Ravenscroft 1609, sig. F2r }
{ SHEPHERD: Come gentle heardman, sitt with me and tune thy pipe by myne }
{ heare vnderneathe this willowe tree to sheild the hote sonne shyne. }
{ HERDSMAN: Alas poore pastor nowe I fynd, thy love is lodgd to(o) highe }
{ that of thy flock thow hast no mynde but feedst a wanton eye. }
{ SHEPHERD: Here I haue framed my sommers bower of proofe for phebus beames }
{ and deckt it up with many a flower sweet seated by the streames }
{ for daphne ever once a day these flowry bancks doth walk }
{ and in her bosom bears a roas(e), the pride of many a stalke. }
{ but leaves the humble hart behind that would her garlands dight }
{ and shee sweet soule the more unkeind to sett trewe love soe light }
{ yet though that others beare the bell as in her favor blest }
{ her shepher(d) loveth her as well as those whom shee loves best. }
{ HERDSMAN:  If daintie daphnes lookes befitt thy doating harts desire }
{ be sure that far beyond thy lott thy liking doth aspire }
{ to love soe sweet a nymphe as shee and look for love againe }
{ is fortune fitting heigh degree not for a shepherd swayne. }
{ for she of lordly ladds is lovde and sought of great estates }
{ her favor scornes to be enjoyed of us poore lowly mates }
{ I reed thee therefor(e) now be wise, goe with me to our wake }
{ wher(e) lovely lasses be not nice, ther(e) like and choose thy make }
{ where are noe pearles nor gould to view, nor pride of sylkin sight }
{ but petticoats of scarlet here that vayles the skinn more wight. }
{ wher(e) is noe muske nor amber fyne to please the dayntie nose, }
{ but wher(e) is worne the sweet woodbynd the violet and the rose }
{ ther(e) trewest turtles bee to gett for love and little cost }
{ ther(e) sweet desire is payd his debt and labor syldome lost. }
