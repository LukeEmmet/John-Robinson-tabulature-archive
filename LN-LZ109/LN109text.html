The variety of names suggests several distinct individuals. The first is represented by six items, four (n<sup>o</sup> 1-4) ascribed to Nan[n]i da Milano and two  (n<sup>o</sup> 5-6)<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> to Giovanni da Milano.<sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Nani is a diminutive form of Giovanni in the Milan dialect,<sup><a href="#endnote-7" id="endnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> so it seems reasonable to assume the ascriptions are to the same person. The six items include a prelude, two courantes, and two saltarellos, as well as a balletto. A clue in the title of the balletto, which translates as 'Ballet of Nani for the arrival of the Queen of Spain', suggests he was associated with the visit to Milan in 1598 of Margaret of Austria (1584-1611), duchess of Savoy and queen of Philip III of Spain.<sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup>  The visit is also described in some detail and some music from the event included in Cesare Negri's treatise on dance <em>Le Gratie d'Amore</em>, published in Milan in 1602.<sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Negri was a dancing master and spent his life in Milan, where he was born <em>c.</em>1535 and died after 1604. In <em>Le Gratie</em> he describes the musical activities associated with the important events in which he directed or performed, including Margaret's visit.<sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> So it seems Negri played some role in organising the festivities and presumably the music for the visit in 1598, and it is possible Nanni composed or performed some of it too and may even have been a pupil of Negri.<sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p><p> Nothing seems to be known about the remaining composers represented here, Giovanni/Johann Pietro (n<sup>o</sup> 7-11), Giovanni Pauli (n<sup>o</sup> 15-16) and Giulio Giovanni (n<sup>o</sup> 12-14), could be by any of the above, or other composers of this name. Only four of the five items are ascribed to Giovanni Pietro, but the similar opening and style of the anonymous n<sup>o</sup> 7 suggests it is also by him. See the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em> for further discussion and music by additional Giovannis, together with all of the anonymous Italian dances from the Donaueschingen manuscript (D-Sl G.I.4) in which some of the music here is found. The Lutezine ends with two fantasias of Albert da Rippe as originally published for renaissance guitar together with lute transcriptions. </p><p>		<em>John H Robinson - March 2014</em></p><p><strong>The complete settings of lute solos by John Dowland - Part 10: n<sup>o</sup> 64 go from my Window &amp; n<sup>o</sup> 69 Loth to Depart</strong></p><p><strong>Worklist</strong><sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p><p><strong>JD64.

Loth to Depart</strong>	DowlandCLM 69</p><p>GB-Cu Dd.9.33, ff. 68v-69v <em>Loth to departe Jo Dowland</em></p><p>For the tenth instalment in the complete Dowland series here are all the lute versions of his variations on two ballad tunes <em>Go from my window</em> and <em>Loth to depart</em> - four of the former and the unique version of the latter.<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> All the other settings of these ballads for lute, cittern, lyra viol, bandora and violin (arranged for lute) can be found in the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>, where the ballads are described in more detail. A ballad titled <em>Goe from my Window</em> was registered in 1588 and the words of the title are quoted or a tune of this name is called for in plays published between 1567 and 1607. However, <em>Loth/Lothe/Loath/Loathe to depart</em> is a common title for any song sung or tune played on taking leave of friends, although the tune for which Dowland composed variations appears most frequently in surviving sources. The title is again quoted or a tune of this name called for in a variety of plays and printed broadsides between 1571 and 1661.</p><p>The four versions of Dowland's setting of <strong>Go from my window</strong> are all for 6-course lute (one for orpharion) and  closely concordant, the principal differences lying in the ornaments and a few subtle but interesting variant readings. All comprise eight variations, all of eight bars in duple time, except variation 5 is in triple time either barred in 16 bars of 6 crotchets (n<sup>o</sup> 64a,b) or 6 bars of 12 crotchets (n<sup>o</sup> 64c,d). N<sup>o</sup> 64a, the version used by Poulton and Lam, was copied by Mathew Holmes into the second of his large solo lute manuscripts (Dd.5.78.3) begun <em>c.</em>1595. He added a few ornaments (only six # in the 1st variation plus one each in the 2nd &amp; 8th, probably for an upper mordent) in different places to the other versions, as well as a smattering of vertical and horizontal (tenuto) ties. N<sup>o</sup> 64b is in the Euing manuscript copied <em>c.</em>1600, which adds vertical ties to nearly all the chords, as well as just seven ornaments, all #, in different places to other versions, except two are also in Barley in a repeated sequence of dotted rhythms in the first 7 bars of the final variation. N<sup>o</sup> 64c is in Jane Pickeringe's lute book copied <em>c.</em>1616-1620 with no ornaments but vertical ties in nearly all the chords as in Euing. N<sup>o</sup> 64d is the earliest and only printed version, published in 1596, and includes the most ornaments, all # (1st &amp; 8th variation plus one at the end of 2nd &amp; 4th), with vertical ties and a few tenuto signs. John Ward refutes Dowland's complaint in his <em>First Booke of Ayres</em> of 1597 (sig. A1r) that <em>There have been diuers Lute-lessons of mine lately printed without my knowledge, falce and vnperfect</em> presumed to be directed at Barley's print in the previous year,<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> and comparison of the versions here show Barley's not to be any more corrupt and in some ways more satisfactory than the surviving manuscript versions. Poulton argued that the manuscript versions were copied from Barley, including the error in bar 68,<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> but this seems unlikely because ornaments in Barley occur in different places or are absent in the manuscripts and the rhythm of the falling phrase in sequence in bars 17, 19 &amp; 21 identical in the manuscripts is quite different in Barley. </p><p>The unique version of <strong>Loth to depart</strong> ascribed to Dowland in Holmes' third solo lute book (Dd.5.78.3) begun <em>c.</em>1600 is for a lute with the 7th course in D and comprises 7 16 bar variations with a few vertical ties and tenuto signs but no ornaments. Poulton explains that the usual division of the original tune is abandoned in favour of variations bearing only a hint of the tune.<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Addendum to Lute News 107 (October 2013)<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup></strong></p><p><strong>Add. a.</strong> D-Sl G.1.4 III, f. 47v <em>Gagliarda de Mons</em>(ieu)<em><sup>r</sup> de Vaumenil</em></p><p><strong>Add. b.</strong> D-W Guelf 18.8 VI, f. 171r <em>Gagliarda J.
