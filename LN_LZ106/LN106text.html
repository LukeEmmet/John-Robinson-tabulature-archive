Vicent. Bernia</em></p><p>Sixteen lute solos for 6-10 course lutes in two prints and six manuscripts are ascribed to ‘Vicenzo Bernia Bollognese’, ‘Bernia’, or ‘V. B.’, probably all by the same early 17th-century composer.<sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Bernia is a typical Bolognese surname, and a Vincenzo Bernia is cited in non-musical documents in Bologna around 1610, which may be the composer of the music here. A Bernia ‘sonator di cetra’ recorded at the Estense court of Ferrara in the middle of the sixteenth century is probably too early but could be a member of the same family. Two of the manuscripts are Italian, US-BEm 757 of Bologna provenance <em>c.</em>1615-30 and I-TRc 1947 of Trent provenance <em>c.</em>1610-30, the other sources originating North of the Alps, suggesting Bernia’s music was known outside Italy. Besard’s <em>Novus Partus</em> (Augsburg 1617) includes three pieces by Bernia, a toccata, a recercar (following the toccata and ascribed <em>dell'istesso</em>, i.e. Bernia too) and <em>Gallus et Gallina</em> imitating the sound of a hen and cock.<sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The toccata is anon in Mylius’ <em>Thesaurus Gratiarum</em> (Frankfurt 1622) and the Rettenwertt MS (CZ.Pnm IV.G.8) from Saltzburg, dated 1623 and 1637, and the recercar was copied into CH-Bfenyves from Bavaria <em>c.</em>1627. The theme is the hexachord (<em>ut re mi fa sol la</em>), appearing at least fifteen times. N<sup>o</sup> 13 is based on the song <em>Madre mia non mi far monaca</em>, used for sets of lute and keyboard variations and usually titled <em>La Monica</em>. Two pieces ascribed by name or initials are in D-B 4022 from Danzig <em>c.</em>1615-20, and the galliarda in the Wurstisen manuscript (CH-Bu F.IX.70) from Basel, dated 1591 and 1594, could be an early work by Bernia.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Vicenzo Bernia’s surviving music is attractive and includes Italian Balletto, as well as French Branle, Volte and Courantes.<em>	John H.

However, in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Ophelia quotes ‘For Bonny sweet Robin is all my joy’ (Act IV Scene 5 line 182 in Alexander text) which fits bars 1-4 and 13-16 of this tune. However, Sternfeld has suggested an alternative text, a verse of ‘In Sherwood lived stout Robin Hood’, n<sup>o</sup> 19 in Robert Jones <em>Fourth Book of Airs</em> of 1609, which also fits the tune:<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup></sup></p><p><em>Hey jolly robin, Ho jolly robin</em></p><p><em>Hey jolly Robin Hood</em></p><p><em>Love finds out me as well as thee</em></p><p><em>To follow me, follow me to the greenwood.</em></p><p>Four very similar versions of John Dowland’s variations on this tune are known, three in English manuscripts and one in Fuhrmann’s continental print of 1615.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> All the other settings for this and a number of other tunes with Robin in the title, for lute, bandora, cittern and lyra viol, are included in the <em>Lutezine</em> accompanying this <em>Lute News</em>. Four of these are anonymous one stave settings, two in D minor and two in C minor, duplicated here as page fillers (appendices 1-4). Dowland’s variations comprise three sections of 24 bars, which Poulton subdivided editorially into two 4 bar A strains, and two 8 bar B strains. Versions <strong>a-c</strong> are closely concordant throughout and lack ornaments and playing indications such as fingering dots, except for vertical ties: versions <strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong> have more or less all the vertical ties found in <strong>a</strong> with many more added. Also the tablature for version <strong>b</strong> is almost identical to <strong>c</strong>, with only 5 or so minor differences, whereas <strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong> have 35 or so subtle differences to <strong>a</strong> (the version used in DowlandCLM), many of which are true variants whereas others are probably errors. In a few places notes are added to complete melodic runs absent in the ‘standard text’ of <strong>a</strong>, giving a more satisfactory reading.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-11" id="endnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup></sup> Poulton considered the version in Fuhrmann (<strong>d</strong>) to be ‘extremely innacurate’ in which ‘A number of bars have been introduced which are in neither [other version]’,<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-12" id="endnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> but it is concordant with <strong>a</strong> except for around 48 subtle differences, including variants and errors some of which are shared with <strong>b/c</strong>, and it is useful to have a setting with an added 7th course in D when <strong>a-c</strong> are for 6-course lute. The only serious corrupt readings are the omission of bar 33, apparent misreading of bars 51-52, and the reversal of bars 49-52 and 53-56, which might explain why Poulton thought bars had been added.</p><p>	<em>John H.
