<p><strong>Music supplement to Lute News 80 (December 2006)</strong></p><p><strong>English Renaissance Pavans and Galliards some in variant tunings </strong></p><p>Assembled here are seven pavans and three galliards plus three items in related forms. Many have elaborate divisions typical of the late Golden Age of English lute music and four are notated in tablature for variant tunings, but here transcribed for standard renaissance lute (vieil ton tuning, G C f a d’ g’).</p><p>The first two are from Mylius’ <em>Thesaurus Gratiarum</em>. The first (n<sup>o</sup> 1) is a full version of a pavan using a 9th course tuned to D (assuming a lute in G), found incomplete in Add.3056. Although anonymous in all sources, it has been suggested Daniel Bacheler is the composer.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The second (n<sup>o</sup> 2) is a pavan for 6-course lute ascribed to Wilhelmi Angli which could refer to William Brade who went to Germany around 1590 and published music for instrumental ensemble 1609-21 in Hamburg and Berlin.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Or could it be William Byrd?</p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 3 is a pavan from the 1580s or before for 6-course lute from Thomas Dallis’ lute book and n<sup>o</sup> 4 is a galliard from Matthew Holmes’ first large lute anthology Dd.2.11 which uses a 7-course lute in variant tuning.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup>  The galliard is anonymous but reminiscent of Anthony Holborne. Two versions of a pavan dedicated to My Lady P are included, n<sup>o</sup> 5a from Dd.2.11 using a 7-course lute in the same variant tuning as n<sup>o</sup> 4 and adjacent to it, and n<sup>o</sup> 5b from William Trumbull’s lute book for a 6-course lute in regular vieil ton tuning. N<sup>o</sup> 5a is a tone above no 5b, which might indicate the variant tuned lute was pitched in F not G. </p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 6 and 7 are an anonymous pavan and galliard pair from Nn.6.36 in a variant tuning for 9c lute<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> which on stylistic grounds could be by Daniel Bacheler. It is not unlikely he experimented with alternative tunings but all the known lute music ascribed to him is in vieil ton tuning.</p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 8 and 9 are two laments from their titles<em>, </em>from Nn.6.36, one for an unidentified Mrs E. B.<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and both for renaissance lute with the 7th course lute tuned to D. Both are reminiscent of Dowland and are adjacent to his Resolution.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> N<sup>o</sup> 10 is a galliard from Add.3056 for renaissance lute with the 7th course tuned to D.</p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 11 is a pavan based on Dowland’s Lachrymae by an otherwise unknown<em> </em>Thomas Moone and copied <em>c</em>1620 into a work of Archimedes from 1644, for 6-course renaissance lute. The first or last few notes on each stave were reconstructed by Robert Spencer, as they were lost by trimming during rebinding at some stage.</p><p>N<sup>o</sup> 12 is a pavan dedicated to John Blundeville, presumably following his death. He may be the John Blundeville to whom eight airs for three viols in GB-Ob Mus. Sch. C.44, ff. 18-19v are ascribed (see theVdGS index). The dedication is followed by the name W. Hollis, an alternative dedicatee, the composer, or even the person who commissioned the composition by a now unknown composer.<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The Nottingham chamberlain’s accounts for 1577/8 show payment of reward to musicians belonging to Sir William Hollys,<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> who could be our W Hollis. The tablature is reproduced as in the original with only minor adjustments to bar lines and occasional rhythm signs especially in the divisions giving a reasonably satisfactory reading of the first two strains and divisions, but the third strain is so corrupt as to be beyond reconstruction so it is reproduced as in the original. Anthony Rooley reconstructed this pavan and recorded it on his long playing record of music from Add.3056 in 1976, regrettably not yet available on CD, and when approached could not locate a copy of his reconstruction. N<sup>o</sup> 13 is an untitled piece for renaissance lute with a 7th course tuned to D, with interesting descending themes, the final item copied by Matthew Holmes into the manuscript Dd.5.78.3, the second of his series of three huge solo lute manuscripts, Dd.2.11 and Dd.9.33 being the others.</p><p>Minor amendments to correct possible errors in the originals have been made without comment.</p><p><strong>Worklist</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p><p>	1.
